            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>Right Honourable and Honourable,</salute>

            <p>AT this time God's Providence hath brought you together, to conſult a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the great Concerns of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and the Matter I now do moſt humbly offer to your ſerious Conſideration, is one of, if not the moſt important that can be laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you; for it doth conduce to the Glory of God, the Peace of the Church, as by Law eſtabliſhed, the Aſſerting and Defence of its Doctrine, and to the Welfare of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>Though I preſume to appear upon ſo high a Stage, and draw upon me the Eyes of as Auguſt, and upon every account as famous an Aſſembly as any in the World: Yet the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject I go upon holding ſo near a Proportion with the Station and Dignity wherein God hath placed you, will I hope ſecure me from
<pb facs="tcp:52204:3"/>being aſperſed with Raſhneſs and Vain-glory, or accounted a Buſie-Body. I offer you a Field of Honour, and an occaſion of exerciſing your Piety towards God, Love to Truth, your Juſtice and Wiſdom with putting a ſtop to and a Curb upon a boundleſs and blaſphemous Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, which ſeems openly to defie Heaven and Earth:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111.3.</note> 'Tis <hi>God's Work,</hi> which, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>is honourable and glorious;</hi> 'tis good, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and great; but Time is ſhort and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, therefore muſt be well improved, for the Opportunity may happen to be loſt, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be recover'd, ſo 'tis wiſhed the thing be done whilſt it may, and before it be too late; to time things well is one of the beſt parts of Prudence, and one of the moſt Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Circumſtances of our Actions: Among the ſeveral Seaſons and Times mention'd by <hi>Solomon</hi> we read of two,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3.7</note> 
               <hi>a time to keep ſilence,</hi> which I look upon to be over, and <hi>a time to ſpeak,</hi> which I take now to be fully come.</p>
            <p>There ought to be a proportion between the Diſtemper and the Remedy, thus extream Diſtempers require extream Remedies, and an extraordinary Neceſſity doth vindicate an extraordinary Method in the Uſe thereof: When the Watchman whoſe immediate Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is to give warning, doth, through Slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſhneſs, or other Cauſe, at the approach of the Enemy, neglect to blow the Trumpet, then every one concern'd in the Community hath right to do't for the Preſervation of the whole. That Paſſage of <hi>Craeſus</hi>'s dumb Son, who one day perceiving how ſome went about to, kill his Father, was ſo much ſtirred as to cry out Murther; though trivial, may well be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="tcp:52204:3"/>upon the preſent occaſion; for no true Chriſtian having before his Eyes the near and great Danger which our holy Religion lies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, upon the account of ſome damnable He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies now more than ever brought in again, but muſt be moved and cry out againſt it: But what do I talk of danger, when the evil it ſelf, the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> are upon us? The Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my is not only at the Gates, but in the very body of the place, and in the Bowels of the Church, and to ſpeak in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s words,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Num.</hi> 16.46.</note> 
               <hi>There is wrath gone out from the Lord, the plague is begun;</hi> for blaſphemous <hi>Socinianiſm</hi> attended by Atheiſm, Deiſm, Prophaneneſs, Immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, yea, and Idolatry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> doth bare and brazen-faced walk in our Streets, as much as in it lyeth, to deprive us of our bleſſed Lord and Saviour, ſo it ſtrikes at no leſs than the Head and Author of our Salvation: And <hi>men are puffed up, and have not rather mourned,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2.</note> 
               <hi>that they that do this deed, might be taken away from among us.</hi> To what purpoſe is Popery or Idolatry expelled, if <hi>Socinianiſm</hi> or Blaſphemy be let in?</p>
            <p>But I am not ſo haſty, as to affirm Popiſh Idolatry to be turned out, for we know too much of the contrary, witneſs thoſe Swarms of Prieſts which are in and about the City, and the many places where, I ſhall not ſay in private, for 'tis publick enough, the Wafer-Idol-Worſhip is performed againſt the Laws of God and of the Land, which ſome that ſhould, do not mind nor care for; whereupon we have much cauſe to renew the Apoſtle's Complaint, <hi>All ſeek their own,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.21.</note> 
               <hi>not the things that are Jeſus Chriſts:</hi> And in the Country al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb facs="tcp:52204:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>every Popiſh Family of any note, hath a Prieſt when able to keep it; all this for want of due care to ſee Laws againſt them put in execution.</p>
            <p>Upon this account a thing there is which doth ſo much lie in my way, as that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not avoid taking notice of it; and indeed the thing is ſo publick, that many have and do daily with a kind of Indignation wonder at it: As in this World nothing is free from God's Juriſdiction, ſo when we have an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſpeak of his Cauſe, nothing hath Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity or Privilege to plead for: Here we have an Ambaſſadour, who for himſelf and Family hath a private Chappel in his own Houſe, and a publick one in a Street not far from it, for any one that hath a mind to come to it: We know it to be a Privilege as good as grounded upon the Right of Nations, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very foreign Miniſter to have within his doors the free Exerciſe of his Religion for his Perſon and Houſhold, but a Plurality hath no ground to plead for: Here it hath been unknown and unheard of ſince the Reformation, that any foreign Miniſter was at any time allow'd two Chappels: In the ſupernumerary one I and many more beſides, to whom it is an Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſore, have on Maſs days ſeen and ſtill can ſee Three or Four Hundred People going in and out, not the Ambaſſador or his Family, if you except the Prieſt and his Clerk, with, may be, ſome inferiour Servants, but general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and perhaps ſome few <hi>Iriſh</hi> and others. We may well remember, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Reign which never was commended for Piety, I mean of <hi>Charles</hi> II. when the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="tcp:52204:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>complained, and the People grumbled about the growth of Popery; that Prince not only ſaid, <hi>Gentlemen, offer what you think fit for the Security of your Religion and Liberty, and I will give my Conſent to't,</hi> but withal, he ſent to all foreign Miniſters to deſire them to receive none of his Subjects within their Chappel Doors; alſo Men were ſent thither to watch who went in and out, to give an account of it: And if we well look into the thing in hand, we may find it is like to be of ill and troubleſom Conſequence; for the Party in queſtion is of a Nation, which when once they have been in poſſeſſion of a thing, will willingly never part with, but for ever lay a claim to't; when this Man is gone, his Succeſſor will, according to their Maxim, never fail to pretend to Two Chappels, and this will be a Precedent for other foreign Popiſh Miniſters to lay claim to Two; for if one hath it, why not another? Which may happen to engage us in ſome Difficulties: Beſides that, here common People love not to ſee unneceſſary Popiſh Monuments, and God knows whether or not at one time or other may not into their Head come ſome fancy of being rude, beſides, thoſe are Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-places for Papiſts to plot againſt the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which Inconveniencies, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive, it were both Piety and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence betimes to prevent, and upon this Motive only, with Submiſſion to Superiors, I ſpeak of it, though Blaſphemy be the thing I now chiefly aim againſt.</p>
            <p>Yet both Idolatry and Blaſphemy are the two greateſt Abominations of all in the ſight of God, for which he deſtroyed the Kingdoms
<pb facs="tcp:52204:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> and overturned the <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, Babylonian,</hi> and other great Empires: And to come home, to the Toleration of thoſe Two tranſcendent Wickedneſſes among others, I think we may chiefly attribute the cauſe of the heavy Chaſtiſements which make the Nation uneaſie, and he is very blind that doth not ſee, and inſenſible that takes no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of both, I mean Sin and Chaſtiſement; and I moſt humbly beſeech God to avert from us that terrible Threatning by his Prophet, for at leaſt we are as bad as thoſe whom 'tis directed to,<note place="margin">

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT is indeed very ſad in a Countrey where the Light of the Goſpel hath ſo clearly ſhined, to ſee the Enemies of Chriſt ſo brazen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd, as not only to Print and Publiſh, but even at the Doors of both Houſes of Parliament to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute their Books full of Blaſphemies, and no other Check put upon them, but burning one Copy, may be of Thouſands diſperſed abroad, which Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity is for them an Encouragement to continue in their Crime.</p>
            <p>In Commendation of the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> I muſt take notice of the Act which in one of their laſt Seſſions was paſſed there againſt Blaſphemy, whereby not only they ratified the <hi>Twenty Firſt</hi> of the firſt Seſſion of <hi>Charles II.</hi> but alſo En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted farther, that whoſoever in Diſcourſe or Writing ſhall deny, quarrel, argue or reaſon againſt the Being of a God, or any of the Perſons of the Bleſſed <hi>Trinity,</hi> or againſt the Authority of the Holy Scripture, or Providence of God in Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the World, ſhall for the firſt time be Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned till he hath in publick acknowledged the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: For the ſecond Offence, Impriſoned and a Fine beſides; and for the third, Death, as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate
<pb facs="tcp:52204:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>Blaſphemers. For indeed, <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> by God's expreſs Command, ought to be deſtroyed out of the Land. Every thing hath its proper Center, heavy things go down, and light fly up; and ſince the Glory of God is the proper Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Man, for he was created to Honor and Serve him, Why then doth he not as well as other Creatures anſwer that end, and with his Heart and utmoſt Endeavours, promote his Glory, and prevent any thing that tends to his Diſhonour? For want of which, when 'tis his Duty and in his Power ſo to do, he becomes guilty of, and makes himſelf acceſſary to the Crime. Certainly, neither Law nor any Judge ought to ſpare at all thoſe Creatures who will not at all ſpare their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:52204:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>infinite Minds and Subſtances, I ſhall make uſe of the words in the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creed, then there are three Eternals, three Incomprehenſibles, three Almighties, three Infinites and three Gods, which all are a meer Contradiction; and <hi>Hierom</hi> was very cautious about acknowledging three <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſes</hi> in the Deity, becauſe he thought the word to denote Subſtance, for fear of owning three Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; but when I think of ſuch, I remember what I read of a Greek Philoſopher, who willing to abound in his own Senſe, would not be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the Definition or Deſcription of Man given by others, how 'tis a <hi>Rational Animal,</hi> but he ſcorning to follow the ſteps of others, forged one of his own, and ſaid, Man is a <hi>two footed Animal without Feathers;</hi> whereupon another having pluckt off a Cock's Feathers, brought it into his School, and ſetting it before his Diſciples, ſaid, behold ſuch a one's Man, and ſo ridiculed the Philoſopher: Thus deſerves to be any one, who being wiſe only in his own Conceit, doth affect ſingularity, and in things of this nature, leaves the good trodden way to follow his own by paths; whoſoever in defence of a Cauſe refuſeth to take up Arms, becauſe once they were made uſe of by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, either declares himſelf an Enemy to the Cauſe, or elſe hath a mind to betray it; in this caſe it may be ſaid as that of an Army marching thorough an Enemies Country, or towards an Enemy: For Orders ſake, and by reaſon of the Danger, no Soldier ought to ſtraggle out of the way under pain of Death, for every one that doth ſo, ventures to be knockt in the Head, and as much as in him lyeth, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardeth the whole; ſo thus acting contrary to Rules and his own Safety, it may well be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, he doth ſo with a Deſign to deſert, the like
<pb facs="tcp:52204:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>may be ſaid of ſtragglers in this Cauſe and War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.</p>
            <p>As formerly, ſo new in the Chriſtian World we may ſay, Chriſt is again crutified between two Malefactors, the <hi>Socinian</hi> Blaſphemy of one ſide, and the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Idolatry on the other. Yet now 'tis worſe than at his Death, for one of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors was converted and became good, but now they both are ſtark naught; the one ſtrikes at his Perſon and Grace, the other chiefly at his Grace; one ſets up his Reaſon, the other his Traditions above and in oppoſition to his Word; the firſt believes worſe but would ſeem to practiſe better; the laſt believeth ſomewhat better, but practiſeth worſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Socinians</hi> which hardly have any thing of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity beſides the bare name, are ſo puffed up with Pride and Self-conceit, and do ſo much abound in their own Senſe, that they deſpiſe all Antient and Primitive Authority, becauſe indeed therein they find their own Condemnation. I muſt ſay how the Conſent and Belief of the Primitive Church in their Councils and Writings of their Doctors, ought not to be heard against Scripture, yet not to be ſlighted or rejected in things wherein they are Orthodox, and when they agree with it.</p>
            <p>They keep a great pother about Reaſon, but they muſt explain themſelves, or elſe they do but leave things in a confuſion; we know every rational Man ought to be guided by Reaſon, but even ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Men do often differ about it: ſometimes that which is Reaſon with one, is a Nonſenſe with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; but to bring a Carnal Reaſon to be a Judge in Spiritual Things,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11, 14.</note> is a very groſs miſtake, for, <hi>the things of God knoweth no man, but the ſpirit of God, and the natural man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
<pb facs="tcp:52204:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>not the things of the ſpirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſs unto him, neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerned;</hi> if this Reaſon they mean in Matters of Religion, it muſt be quite turned out, for Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture declares it in ſuch things not to be a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Judge: But if by Reaſon they mean the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of things, then I own nothing ought to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that is contrary to it; yet in this Senſe, no reaſonable Man but will own Reaſon in very many things, though in ſome more or leſs, to be very lame and weak, but perfect in nothing, for conſidering the Perfection either of Parts or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, we all may be ſaid to know nothing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, though Learning and Experience do come in to help us, yet ſtill ſomething is wanting; what one ſaid well, <hi>Nemo unquam omnes fefellit, neminem unquam omnes fefellere,</hi> never one Man deceived all, nor ever all Men together de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any one, may with ſome alteration accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the diverſity of the Subject be ſaid here, never as yet one Man knew all things, neither did all Men ever know one thing ſo perfectly, but that it might ſtill admit of ſome additional Degree of Knowledge and Perfection; yet I will ſuppoſe an unpoſſible thing that one Man ſhould by ſtrength of Reaſon know all things, which is one of God's Attributes; however, when this Reaſon happeneth to be in competition with a Line or two of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, is not that Man according to true Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, bound to ſubmit to it? For my part, I declare I ſhall ever prefer the Authority of one only Text of Scripture before all the Reaſon of the World, whether laying in one Head or many; and my Reaſon is, that Scripture is the Word of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible God, when all and every Man in the World are fallible. Alas, how many things in the
<pb facs="tcp:52204:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>World are given for Reaſon, which have only a ſhew and appearance of it: Beſides, it muſt be granted, there are things above Reaſon, the moſt thinking and learned, if not much ſelf-conceited, will by their own experience find this to be true, even in natural things, how much more in thoſe of a ſpiritual and divine Nature, which to Men's underſtanding are paſt finding out; wherefore I affirm it to be but reaſonable for them in ſuch things to ſubmit Reaſon to Faith, which is a Myſtery to our natural Reaſon,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.9.</note> ſo called by <hi>S. Paul, Holding the myſtery of Faith in a pure conſcience,</hi> when he was writing this, Faith with its Object was clearly revealed, yet ſtill he then calls it a Myſtery, and I hope no <hi>Socinian</hi> dares ſay he knows the Nature of Faith better than that great Apoſtle did.</p>
            <p>As for Scripture, they pretend to own and do quote it, ſo alſo could the Devil, but miſ-apply'd it: Before him whom he knew to be the Son of God he could ſay, <hi>it is written:</hi> And as in the beginning of the Predication of the Goſpel, ſo in the renewing of the Truth of it by <hi>Reformation,</hi> Tares ſprung up with the Grain, ſome Men would not order and regulate their Opinions according to Scripture, but would bring it to be ſubſervient to their Notions, and of it to make a Noſe of Wax to ſerve their turn; hence it is that they wreſt things that therein are ſo plain, which if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.16.</note> muſt be <hi>to their own deſtruction.</hi> I know of no wrong the Son of God hath done them, that in all their Writings they ſhould ſo ſlightly ſpeak of and ſo much below him: Of late one <hi>S—</hi> among others,<note place="margin">Page 20.</note> ſaith of the Lord Jeſus, <hi>In that great Inſtance of Magnanimity, he hath outdone all the mentioned Heroes of</hi> Greece <hi>and</hi> Rome; he would ſeem to ſpeak much
<pb facs="tcp:52204:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>in his Commendation, but <hi>latet anguis in herbâ,</hi> there is a Malice in the bottom, to enervate the Truth of our Saviour's Life, as if there were in't ſome of the Tales and fabulous Accounts which are found in the Lives of the Heroes be mentions: They would have him a Man, and nothing more, though upon all occaſions, even before that wicked Counſel of the Prieſts, Scribes, and Elders,<note place="margin">Matt. 26.63, 64.</note> being <hi>by the High Prieſt adjured in the Name of the Living God, to tell whether he was the Son of God?</hi> He owned himſelf to be, which he would not have done if it had not been true, and ſo had died to maintain a Lye, which is the part of an Impoſtor, and this Confeſſion of his being Son of God, was the very ground of his Accuſation, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, and Execution; <hi>we have a law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 19.7.</note> ſaid they, <hi>and by our law he ought to die, becauſe he made himſelf the Son of God,</hi> and at the time of his Death, all their Revilings and Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries againſt him did run upon this,<note place="margin">Matt. 27.40, 43, 54.</note> 
               <hi>If thou be the Son of God, come down from the croſs,</hi> and <hi>he ſaid, I am the Son of God;</hi> it had been very ſtrange if he had ſuffered for ſaying he was that which he was not, in the Senſe he ſpoke it and they took it: To deny this is to be worſe than the very Heathens the <hi>Roman</hi> Soldiers; for the <hi>Centurion</hi> and they that were with him, having ſeen the things that were done, ſaid, <hi>Truly this was the Son of God,</hi> thereby pointing at the Cauſe of his Death, as if they had ſaid, He was what he affirmed himſelf to be, and what he dyed for, that is, Truly the Son of God.</p>
            <p>What S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in another Caeſe about the Reſurrection,<note place="margin">Acts 26.8</note> 
               <hi>Why ſhould it be thought incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with you, that God ſhould raiſe the dead?</hi> We may ſay it in that of the Incarnation of the
<pb facs="tcp:52204:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>Son of God; for if God, attended by two Angels in the ſhape of Men,<note place="margin">Gen. 18.</note> more familiarly to dine and converſe with <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſhewed how he could aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the Figure of a Man, why might he not in time take upon him our humane Nature? The Scripture being ſo full of Evidences that he could, he would and hath done it: But what can we ſay of People, who deny it to be day, though the Sun ſhineth never ſo brightly; like the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers Maid, who being blind would not own it, but ſaid the Room ſhe was in was dark; this is the caſe of thoſe in whom the God of this World hath ſo blinded the Minds, that they cannot, and their Hearts that they will not ſee.</p>
            <p>I wiſh God may be pleaſed in this high Concern of his, to ſtir up the Hearts of every one to act in his Station whether Civil or Eccleſiaſtical: They which in this laſt Capacity are Men of Piety and Learning, might, out of Preſſes and Pulpits, be very inſtrumental in aſſerting the Truth, if they were pleaſed to conſult with Scripture preferably before their own Reaſon; for the Word of God being the Spring of right Reaſon, will afford Reaſons enough to confute and convince Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and Hereſie: Therein lies our ſtrength about theſe Matters: This ought to be the method and manner of thoſe who engage in the Cauſe. Let us all well obſerve what is ſaid of <hi>Apollos,</hi> who in this ſame Subject was concerned againſt an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving and obſtinate Nation,<note place="margin">Acts 18.24.</note> that <hi>he was mighty in the Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About theſe Controverſies ſome thing hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy been attempted by Men otherwiſe of Learning and good Parts, but upon the account of ſome Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of theirs, little good is herein to be expected from them; <hi>Arminians</hi> I mean, whom I look upon
<pb facs="tcp:52204:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>as not very ſit to write againſt <hi>Socinians,</hi> no more than <hi>Arminus</hi> would not write against <hi>Socinus,</hi> though they were contemporary; when I am rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Socinian</hi> Diſputes, I often in my way meet with <hi>Worſtius, Epiſcopius, Bertius, Curcelaeus,</hi> and ſuch others who favour them, if not in all, yet in too many things wherein they go hand in hand, and they will mince the matter with them; but if after what ſeveral Men have written here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, ſome other Perſons of Learning, and ſound in the doctrinal part of the <hi>XXXIX.</hi> Articles, would now appear as a Reverend and very able Prelate hath in ſome Points effectually done, then it might be hoped, through God's Bleſſing, for us to ſee thoſe impious and Heterodox Opinions juſtled out of doors, to the Honour of God, the Peace of his Church, and clearing the Land of ſuch a Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as in ſome reſpect may be called worſe than the Devils,<note place="margin">Matt. 8.29. Mar. 1.24 <hi>and</hi> 5.7. Luke 4.34, 41. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8.28. Pſal. 119.126.</note> who publickly owned the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> to be <hi>the Son of God, of the moſt high God, the holy one of God,</hi> whom they confeſſed to have the Power not only to command but alſo to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and deſtroy them, whilſt theſe Men deny him truly to be ſuch: With <hi>David</hi> we muſt ſay, <hi>It is time for thee, Lord, to work: for they have made void thy law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, though very ſenſible of my Weakneſs and Incapacity, I preſume to appear in publick, truſting in him whoſe Cauſe we defend, that he will make his Virtue perfect in our Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and with the gracious Influence of his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſupply that which is wanting in us: Herein I handle not only ſome things of the Controverſie, but alſo do in ſome meaſure bring in the doctrinal part, which is a great help to the <hi>Elenctical,</hi> and upon which indeed this laſt must be grounded; for I
<pb facs="tcp:52204:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>writ not only to refute, but alſo to inſtruct and afford a Preſervative againſt the Poyſon: And tho' ſometimes I bring in things which directly relate to the Jews, yet they reach <hi>Socinians</hi> as well as <hi>Jews,</hi> for both are Enemies; the firſt indeed deny Chriſt to be the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> though the Antients owned him to be God, and <hi>Socinians</hi> own him to be a <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> but deny him to be true God. I omit, the Debate about the Divinity of the Holy Ghoſt, and of the high Point of Chriſt's Satisfaction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Meditation on the moſt holy Trinity and the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> his Divinity, affording Matter enough to fill up theſe Sheets, wherein, I hope, the Truth is cleared and confirmed, and Errour refuted: If the Reader findeth good by it, as I pray God be may, as it doth come from God, ſo from firſt to laſt, let him return the whole Praiſe and Glory to him whom alone it belongeth unto.</p>

                  <hi>Laelius Socinus,</hi> Son to <hi>Marius Socinus,</hi> a famous Lawyer of <hi>Siena,</hi> came alſo to <hi>Geneva,</hi> which, at that time, was the great place of refuge for thoſe who went out of <hi>Italy</hi> and neighbouring Countries to forſake <hi>Popery,</hi> where he was known to <hi>Calvin;</hi> and thence he went to <hi>Zurich;</hi> but <hi>Calvin</hi> having found him out, did write him two ſharp Letters, one in 1552. the other in 1555. at <hi>Zurich</hi> he did, but under the borrow'd Name of <hi>Martinus Bellius,</hi> write ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſhew how <hi>Servetus</hi> had unjuſtly been put to death: In his Commentary upon the firſt Chapter of <hi>John,</hi> he lays the Foundation of whole <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> which, indeed, is but a <hi>Chaos</hi> and Confuſion of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and ſpiritual Ignorance, and a meer Contempt of the Word of God; <hi>Zanchius</hi> was one of the firſt that refuted it. This <hi>Loelius,</hi> all the while he converſed with <hi>Zanchius,</hi> never opened himſelf to him, only ſeemed to propound him Queſtions according to the Schoolway, to exerciſe his Parts, but not to be poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; ſo that indeed he impoſed upon him and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanchton,</hi> ſo cunning was he not to diſcover his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
               <p>Bur his Nephew <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> born in <hi>Siena</hi> in 1538. was a bolder Man, of acute Parts, but a Sophiſter, and conſequently fit to perfect the Hereſie which the other was broaching: He, with his Uncle, went firſt to <hi>Geneva,</hi> afterwards to <hi>Zurich:</hi> at <hi>Baſil</hi> he made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with <hi>Sebaſtian Caſtellio,</hi> of whom he learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſomething in the Hebrew and Greek Languages, and the<note n="*" place="margin">That Chriſt is merely Man, and had no Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till his Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> 
                  <hi>Samoſatenian</hi> Hereſie. His Uncle being dead in <hi>Zurich</hi> in 1562. the 37th of his Age, at which time <hi>Fauſtus</hi> was 23 years old, as ſoon as he heard of his death, he went to the place to ſecure his Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts (which he had deſired him to publiſh in due time) for fear they ſhould fall into other hands: with theſe <hi>Fauſtus</hi> went into <hi>Italy,</hi> where for about Twelve Years he lived about the Duke of <hi>Florence</hi>'s Court, whence he returned to <hi>Baſil</hi> in 1574. the 35th of his Age, and there lived Three Years, thence he went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> about 1577. laſtly into <hi>Poland,</hi> in 1579. about the 40th of his Age, where he made it his whole buſineſs to propagate his Uncles Opinions:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52204:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>There he publiſh'd <hi>Caſtellio</hi>'s Pelagian Dialogues about Predeſtination, Election, Free-Will, and Faith, with a Preface of his own, under the Name of <hi>Felix Turpio,</hi> which Book, <hi>Arminians,</hi> becauſe it ſerved their turns, cauſed to be reprinted with Additions at <hi>Gouda</hi> in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in 1613. He alſo in the Year 1582. being in <hi>Cracovia,</hi> publiſhed a Tract of his upon a part of the Seventh Chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> wherein he endeavours to prove how in that place S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of himſelf not as being a regenerate Man; and in that too he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſeth his Name, as the manner is among peſtilent Hereſiarks, the more eaſily and ſafely to ſpread the Poyſon, and wound Souls with an unknown and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible hand; in that Book he calls himſelf <hi>Proſper Dyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeus,</hi> which anſwers to his true Name <hi>Fauſtus Socinus,</hi> as alſo doth his other borrow'd Name of <hi>Felix Turpio;</hi> for the three Latin Words <hi>Proſper, Felix,</hi> and <hi>Fauſtus</hi> ſignifie the ſame; alſo the Words <hi>Dyſidaeus, Turpio,</hi> and <hi>Socinus</hi> have the ſame ſignification; the firſt is Greek <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>This I have been the more particular upon, becauſe he is look'd upon as the chief Promoter and Publiſher of an Hereſie, which, of all the reſt amongſt <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> is the moſt unworthy of the Name of Chriſt, whereof it hath but the ſhadow, and in ſome reſpect, is worſe than <hi>Heatheniſm,</hi> makes way for <hi>Mahometiſm, Juda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſm,</hi>

               <p>Hereunto I ſhall add only this, how theſe Hereſies had ſome other Followers, which made ſome noiſe in the World, <hi>George Blandrata</hi> of <hi>Saluzze,</hi> and <hi>Paul Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciati</hi> of <hi>Milan,</hi> both <hi>Italians</hi> and Phyſicians, after <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetus</hi>'s death and <hi>Gentilis</hi>'s Recantation, fled into <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: Bernard Ochinus</hi> (a true Diſciple of <hi>Socinus,</hi> as the other two were of <hi>Gentilis</hi>) who, for ſome impure Dialogues of his, had been expell'd out of <hi>Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich</hi> and <hi>Baſil:</hi> all of them were in the Year 1565. baniſhed out of <hi>Poland,</hi> by reaſon of their Hereſie: <hi>Alciati</hi> went into <hi>Turky</hi> and embraced <hi>Mahometaniſm: Ochinus</hi> into <hi>Moravia</hi> to the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> and <hi>Blandrata</hi> fled into <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> where, by the Favour of one <hi>Francis David,</hi> he was entertained as Phyſitian to the Prince; this <hi>David</hi> differ'd from <hi>Socinus,</hi> in that he denyed Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be adored, or any Prayers to be made in his Name. This is that helliſh Covy of abominable and pernicious Fowl, and that Generation of Vipers, out of which ſprung ſince, and now more than ever, many of the kind; ſo that Den is, like <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> to ſpeak in Scripture Language<note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52204:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>to laſt: They believe that Man, before his Fall, was naturally mortal; ſo God's threatning, <hi>the day that thou eateſt thou ſhalt ſurely dye,</hi> was frivolous; then that by the Light of Nature, no Man can have the knowledg of God; that Man before his Fall had no original Righteouſneſs, and that there is in us no ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin, as it imports Deformity of Nature: They ſay there is in us free Will to that which is good; that the Cauſes of Predeſtination are not in God, but in Men; and that he doth not predeſtinate to Salvation any particular and certain Perſon; and that Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation may be fruſtrated: As to Providence, they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert that God hath no fore-knowledg of Contingencies determinately, but alternatively; and as to moſt of theſe Matters of Grace and Providence, they are agreed with <hi>Arminians:</hi> Further, they ſay that God could juſtly pardon our Sins without any Satisfaction; that Chriſt, by his Death, did not ſatisfie for us, but only obtained for us Power to ſatisfie for our ſelves by our Faith and Obedience; that Chriſt dyed for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that is, not for his Sins, but for the Mortality and Infirmities of our Nature which he took upon him; Chriſt became not our High Prieſt, nor immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal nor impaſſible before he aſcended into Heaven; that everlaſting Death is nothing elſe but a perpetual Continuance in death or Annihilation; that Eternal Fire is ſo called from its Effect, which is the eternal extinction or reducing to nothing of the Wicked which ſhall be found alive at the laſt Day. They would have Chriſt's Incarnation to be againſt Reaſon and Scripture, they deny him to be truly God; the like of the Holy Ghoſt: That there is in One God no Trinity of Perſons; and that the Old Teſtament is needleſs for Chriſtians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All theſe and other Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies are found in the Works of <hi>Socinus,</hi> in the <hi>Racovian</hi> Catechiſm, whereof <hi>Smalcius</hi> is the Author, of <hi>Oſtorodius, Crellius, Wolkelius, Vaydovius, &amp;c.</hi> but we ſhall, by the Grace of God, inſiſt only upon ſome of their greateſt Blaſphemies.

               <p>Matters of this high Nature and fundamental Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to our Holy Religion, muſt not be proſtituted
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52204:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>to the captious ſcanning of Men of corrupt Minds, nor the ways of God be made layable to the Judgment of Men, rather humbly to be adored with Submiſſion of Mind and Obedience of Faith to the Revelation declared in God's Word; and herein we ought the more to be ſober and cautious that we know Errors to be link'd together, and to have a dependency one upon another; he that ſtrikes at the Grace of the Lord Jeſus, will afterwards make no Conſcience to fly out againſt his Perſon; he who denies him to be a Prophet, will ſoon diſown him to be a King and a Prieſt; for as one Depth calls to another, ſo an <hi>Arminian</hi> can eaſily become a rank <hi>Pelagian</hi> and <hi>Socinian:</hi> Wherefore 'tis neceſſary, at the very beginning, to oppoſe Errors, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend every inch of ground againſt ſuch as will daily grow worſe and worſe, as do <hi>the</hi>

               <p>The Divinity of Chriſt was the Stumbling-block to the Jews, who could not endure to hear him call him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Son of God abſolutely and without limitation, and thereat were enraged, which made 'em take up Stones to caſt at him, <hi>John</hi> 8.59. and alſo at another time, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.31. the Doctrines about the Holy <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> and the <hi>Perſon</hi> and <hi>Deity</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> do ſtand and fall together.

               <p>Before we enter upon this important Matter, ſome things to clear the ſtate of the Queſtion muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, ſo that we muſt ſhew wherein we agree, before we ſpeak of that wherein we differ, as to the firſt this Foundation muſt be laid, there is a God the Cauſe of all, the Effect of none, who hath made all, and is made by none, who hath given all things their Being, and hath his own of himſelf: This is not denyed, ſo I ſhall not go about to prove it, the Light of Nature, the Book of Scripture, and the Teſtimony of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, do ſufficiently convince Men of it. The next thing is, what God is? He being infinite cannot be defined, but imperfectly deſcribed, only according to what he hath in his Word revealed of himſelf, how he is infinite, independent, ſelf-ſufficient, eternal, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable. But ſuch is the blindneſs of ſome Mens Judgments, or the Perverſeneſs of their Hearts, that they will cavil at the Nature, Names, Attributes, and Works of this eternal and infinite Being.</p>

So that if the chief Aſſertion contained in the Revelation be true, ſo muſt alſo be whatſoever is therein included, and in the Explication thereof drawn by a true and right Conſequence: Wherefore, ſeeing God hath declared Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt to be One God, it neceſſarily follows they are One in Nature; becauſe therein only they can be One: And this is the ground of any other Unity; and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is alſo declared they are Three, it muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of three diſtinct Perſons or Subſiſtences where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in only it is poſſible they can be Three.</p>
               <p>The Revelation is clear, there is One God, this God is Father called God, Son called God, Holy Ghoſt called God; and here the Enemies of Truth ſhould begin their Oppoſition, which is the true way and method, yet they do not, but they except againſt the <hi>Explication,</hi> which only tends to farther Edifying and Inſtruction, and quarrel with Words, as <hi>Eſſence, Trinity, Perſons,</hi> &amp;c.

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52204:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Truth doth not depend upon our Apprehenſion and Underſtanding of it, but upon the Conſent of the Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtaments; and tho', under the firſt, Men were more in the dark, yet there was Light enough to make 'em believe it with humble Faith and Piety; but under the laſt, that Truth is clearly apparent, <hi>'tis by</hi>

               <p>This very thing hath, of late, led if not tumbled ſome into ſtrange and horrid Precipices, which, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void, they more and more intangled themſelves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as hath well been obſerved by others; 'tis no good Conſequence for ſuch to ſay, that if a Perſon be a Mind, a Spirit, and a Subſtance, then Three Perſons muſt be Three diſtinct Minds, Spirits, and Subſtances, as diſtinct as <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> though not ſeparate: But the Error of the Hypotheſis lies in this which openeth the falſe Ground thereof, namely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Mind, Spirit, and Subſtance, in their proper ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, are abſolute; but Perſon, in its proper ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, is a relative Term: becauſe King <hi>William</hi> is King of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> muſt we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, that ſince a King is a Man, an Animal, a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, therefore, becauſe of Three diſtinct, ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Kingdoms, he is Three diſtinct Men, Three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Animals, and Three diſtinct Subſtances; not ſo, becauſe Man, Animal, and Subſtance are Terms abſolute, but King is relative.

I think not, becauſe Man, Animal, Subſtance are Terms abſolute, but Dean is relative.

               <p>I know there are certain Terms to be explained in the Diſcuſſion of theſe Controverſies, eſpecially in the Schools, as, may be, <hi>Eſſence, Exiſtence, Subſiſtence, Subſtance, Individuum, Suppoſitum, Hypoſtaſis,</hi> or <hi>Perſon,</hi> wherein they agree, and wherein they differ; but I conceive they who writ for a publick good, and would make theſe Points intelligible to moſt, if not to all Readers, might well avoid too far engaging in Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical Notions; I humbly conceive it were better, becauſe more profitable<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in a <hi>Theological</hi> way to write and explain that which is moſt neceſſary to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood according to the Pattern of Scripture and the Practice of the Orthodox Primitive Church, and of its Doctors, againſt Hereticks, as we have it in the three <hi>Creeds,</hi> which are a production of their univerſal Conſent: But for ſome Men, herein thus far to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge their fancy, as to let it ſpatiate as much as it will, and give it a full Latitude to wander, and then expreſs it ſelf in ſuch Terms as one of a Hundred Thouſand can hardly underſtand the meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: Nay, upon reaſonable grounds, it may be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whether the Author doth well underſtand them; this is only to intricate the Matter, to puzzle the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and that which is worſe, to want a due reſpect for the Majeſty of God, whoſe Myſteries ought to be handled with an awful Reverence; no Man may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to know of him beyond what he hath been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to reveal himſelf; for if we cannot well and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly know things created, much leſs the Creator, neither can the leſs comprehend the greater; and if<note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>When Scripture ſaith, there is <hi>One</hi> God, this One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs can relate to nothing but to the Being, Eſſence, or Nature of God; for in this reſpect, God is one; ſo we have reaſon thereby to repreſent the Unity of the Godhead; there is in Scripture mention of God's <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi>

Hereupon we muſt know how in the moſt Holy Trinity ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is common to the Three Perſons, ſuch is the Eſſence, and ſomething incommunicable and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to every one in their reſpective relations: We ought further to know how the Words Eſſence, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and Nature, though in ſome reſpect they may admit of ſome difference, yet when ſpoken of the Godhead they are taken for one and the ſame: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto may be added Deity and God's being, there is in Schools of Divinity and Philoſophy but one Greek word <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52204:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>for them to follow the <hi>Theſes</hi> of the Text, among Attributes of what we call <hi>Eſſence, Metaphyſicians</hi> reckon this to be one, that it is to be participatively indiviſible, becauſe 'tis equally imparted to thoſe whoſe Eſſence it is; for if there was any Addition, Diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Alteration, it would not be the ſame; much more and upon a better account doth this hold about that Divine Nature by the Apoſtle in the very words at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed unto God, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. In the Godhead there is no Diviſion, only Diſtinction, the Eſſence and Perſons not really but rationally diſtinct; for the Eſſence is whole and indiviſible in every Perſon, but the Perſons be really di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct one from another, by means of ſome incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Attribute; for the Father is not the Son, nor the Son the Father, nor the Holy Ghoſt either Father or Son.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Eſſence</hi> is, as School-men ſay, the <hi>Quiddity</hi> of the thing, that whereby the thing is what it is; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which this is to be obſerved, the Eſſence nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther begetteth nor is begotten, it neither breatheth nor is breathed; this is the Attribute of the Perſon not of the Nature; nevertheleſs, in the Generation and Breathing is the whole Eſſence, becauſe 'tis indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, communicated to the Perſon begotten, the Son, and to the proceeding, the Holy Ghoſt, and 'tis true, the Son is begotten of the Eſſence of the Father, for he is God of God, Light of Light, and to his only begotten Son the Father hath given all things, except to be Father, according to that ſaying of our bleſſed Saviour<note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>BUT this leads me to ſpeak of the Perſons, and upon the matter 'tis fit to know in general what a Perſon is, namely one <hi>particular</hi> thing <hi>indiviſible, incommunicable, living, reaſonable, ſubſisting in it ſelf,</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:52204:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>and not having part of another; the <hi>firſt,</hi> becauſe no general Notion is a Perſon; the <hi>ſecond,</hi> becauſe a Perſon may not be divided into many parts; the <hi>third,</hi> becauſe thô one may communicate his Nature, yet his Perſonality he cannot communicate; the <hi>fourth,</hi> no Perſon without Life and Reaſon; the <hi>fifth,</hi> becauſe every Perſon is a Being that hath its own proper ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting; thus Chriſt's Humanity is not a Perſon, becauſe it doth not ſubſiſt in it ſelf; the <hi>ſixth,</hi> becauſe that which is part of another is no Perſon; thus the Soul of Man ſeparated from the Body is no Perſon. Now the words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> are of a larger ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent than that of Perſon, for they are ſpoken of any <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual</hi> Subſtance; but a Perſon is an individual Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, complete, rational, and as we ſaid, differing from another by means of ſome incommunicable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty: Hence we ſay that a Perſon in the Trinity is whole God, not abſolutely or ſimply conſider'd, but by means of ſome perſonal Propriety; 'tis not a <hi>Species</hi> of God, or of the Deity, nor part, nor a thing dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the Deity, nor a bare relation, or only a manner of being and ſubſiſting, but 'tis the Eſſence of God with a certain manner of ſubſiſting, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, neither is it a Compound of the Eſſence or of the manner of ſubſiſting.</p>
               <p>So then a Perſon of the Deity is uſually deſcribed to be an incommunicable Subſiſtence of the divine Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; for in One and moſt ſimple nature of God are ſeveral Perſons diſtinct, to whom the infinite and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Nature of One onely God is common; for Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture doth teach us, that there is but One God, and Three diſtinct Perſons, to whom it doth attribute the Proprieties of God, whence we may conclude, that there is in God Oneneſs or Unity of Eſſence and Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Perſons: This is matter of Faith to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and not of Fact to be cavil'd at: Hence we find how in Scripture the word God is ſometimes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the Eſſence and Nature of God, and at other times for certain Perſons of the Godhead, as we ſhall have occaſion to ſhew; the Father hath his Eſſence originally in himſelf, and from none other; the Son
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52204:31"/>and the Holy Ghoſt have the ſelf-ſame increated Eſſence in themſelves, as well as the Father, but not from themſelves; the Son and Holy Ghoſt are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the ſame nature with the Father, not in the ſame ſenſe as Men are among themſelves, for Men are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided one from another, but the Perſons of the bleſſed Trinity not ſo, for they be abſolutely undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, ſo that the Three are but One God. The <hi>Greeks</hi> call <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a Perſon in the ſame ſignification as we uſe when we ſay the Perſon of the Son and of the Holy Ghoſt: Now Scripture names them as things diſtinguiſhed between themſelves, individual, ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as we ſaid juſt before, if they be, as they are, working and acting, then they are Perſons ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Axiome</hi> in Philoſophy, <hi>actiones ſunt ſuppoſitorum:</hi> Now if the Father be ſuch, if the Son and Holy Ghoſt be ſuch, what can hinder us from ſaying, the Father is a Perſon, the Son is a Perſon, the Holy Ghoſt is a Perſon? The <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers made uſe of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which in<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3.</note> Scripture we find in the ſame ſenſe, that is, Perſon, as we uſe it, where Chriſt is called <hi>the expreſs Image of his</hi> [the Father's] <hi>perſon:</hi> I ſay, they made uſe of it againſt Hereticks who denyed Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt to be Three things, ſo different as that the one is not and cannot be the other; though as I already ſaid, in Scripture we have not in ſo many Letters the Words of Unity, Trinity, Eſſence, and Perſon, yet we therein have the things themſelves whence they be derived, and the very Words we find uſed by many of the antient Fathers.</p>
               <p>Now Perſon and <hi>Perſonality</hi> are in divine much different of what they are in human things, becauſe the one is infinite and the other finite; human Nature is One, but in <hi>Specie</hi> in many Perſons, as <hi>Peter, James, Paul,</hi> but divine Nature is but One and the ſame in number, exiſting in Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; as far as we are able to apprehend, the Perſon differs from the Nature not <hi>really</hi> but <hi>rationally,</hi> as the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. of a thing from the thing it ſelf, as may be a degree of heat from the heat it comes to: Divine
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52204:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>Eſſence is whole in every Perſon, but not as the whole is in its parts; for 'tis not divided as we ſaid, but indiviſible; now the manner of ſubſiſting of the Divine Eſſence, which is but One in number in Three Perſons, is incomprehenſible and unexpreſſible, and the manner how the Godhead is attributed to the Three, is ſingular and wonderful, which no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can demonſtrate, nor Example illuſtrate; to which purpoſe, ſaith our Saviour<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.22.</note> 
                  <hi>No man knows who the ſon is but the father, and who the father is but the ſon, and to whom the ſon will reveal him:</hi> By virtue of that Revelation, the manner of knowing the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is not the ſame as is in the Son; yet Nature doth not produce Nature, nor Nature Perſon, nor Perſon Nature; but Perſon doth Perſon, not of the Eſſence, but in unity of the ſame Nature, common to the Three Perſons, neither doth it produce with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it ſelf as in corporeal things, becauſe no Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netration of Dimenſion, but within it ſelf, for 'tis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite: Now the Father gives Nature to the Son, and both to the Holy Ghoſt, not by Alienation, but by Communication, which is ſo imparted to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, as that it ſtill remains in the Giver, as one Light hath it from another, without any Diminution: Hence it is that one Perſon doth not ſubſiſt without the other, as 'tis in Men, but all Three do, one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in another; this made our Saviour ſay<note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>ALthough the matter about the divine Nature, and the Three Perſons which we have already ſpoken of, be but one and the ſame with that of the moſt adorable Trinity, as indeed they in Diſcourſe are Parts one of another, and ſo twiſted and connexed together that what we ſpeak of one hath a Relation to, and Dependency upon the other, yet before we come to the <hi>Polemical</hi> or Controverſial Part of theſe Points, we by the Grace of God, ſhall under the Head of the Bleſſed <hi>Trinity,</hi> continue to ſpeak of the <hi>Didactical</hi> or Doctrinal Part of our Diſcourſe, the more to inculcate into the Minds of the Readers leſs acquainted with theſe Diſputes, what Grounds they ought to go upon, and to believe concerning theſe Fundamentals of our Faith, and neceſſary Doctrines of our Salvation. What we believe about it, is above, not againſt Reaſon, for we believe not One God to be many Gods, nor Three Perſons to be but One Perſon: If in Human Things I ſhould ſay <hi>abſolutely,</hi> I <hi>James,</hi> am Father and Son, it were a Contradiction indeed, but to ſpeak it <hi>relatively,</hi> there is none at all; I cannot ſay, I am Son and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to my Father, or Father and Son to my Son, but I may very well ſay I <hi>James</hi> one Man, am upon a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Account, and in a different Relation, Son and Father, in regard to my Father I am a Son, in relation to my Son, I am a Father; let the great Maſters of, or pretenders to Reaſon, herein ſhew me a Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; no more can they, when I ſay, in the Godhead is one Eſſence or Nature, ſubſiſting in Three Perſons, and Three Perſons exiſting in One Eſſence, Unity in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity.</p>
               <p>This great Point is not only very hard and difficult by reaſon of the Myſtery of the Eternal, unſpeakable
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52204:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>and incomprehenſible Generation of the Son of God by the Father, but alſo of a moſt high Concernment; <hi>Firſt,</hi> Upon the Account of God's Glory, for to deny this Doctrine, is to deny the True God, becauſe<note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>John</hi> 2.23.</note> 
                  <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever denieth the Son, the ſame hath not the-Father. Secondly,</hi> Upon the Account of our Salvation, which by no means can be obtained without it, let <hi>Arminians</hi> ſay on the contrary what they will. For,<note n="†" place="margin">

               <p>We ſay, <hi>Trinity</hi> or <hi>Triunity</hi> not <hi>Triplicity,</hi> for this laſt implies a Compoſition of Three Parts; Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, are <hi>alius &amp; alius,</hi> not <hi>aliud &amp; aliud,</hi> other and other, but not other thing and other thing; Three diſtinct Perſons, but One and the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; we diſtinguiſh the Perſons, ſaith<note n="*" place="margin">De Trin. &amp; <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nit. <hi>cap. 11.</hi>

                  <hi>Auſtin,</hi> but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide not the Deity or Eſſence; they are not diſtinct Eſſentially, for there is but one Eſſence, but perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that is, one Perſon is not the other, the Father not the Son, nor the Son the Father, and the Holy none of the other two: <hi>Peter, Paul</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> are not only diſtinct amongſt themſelves, but alſo divided one from another; ſo they are three Men, though but one ſpecifical Nature, becauſe created and finite; but in an infinite Being 'tis otherwiſe, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, though diſtinct, yet not divided; for there is but one numerical Nature, the three are Conſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial or Coeſſential in Nature, Coeternal in Time, and Coequal in Power.</p>
               <p>The Knowledge of One God may be had by the Light of Nature, but that of the Holy Trinity, only out of Scripture, for the one is according to Reaſon, but the other above it; two ways there are to know God, the <hi>1ſt.</hi> Nature, the <hi>2d.</hi> Revelation; that, is defectuous, this is perfect to which God tied his Church, which alone knoweth and calleth upon God according to what he manifeſted of himſelf in his Holy Word, and thereby her Religion is different from that of all the reſt of the World, and there is no other ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving way to come to God but by Chriſt, whoſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52204:34"/>is preached as the only Doctrine of Salvation; and we muſt not have of God ſuch Notions as our Fancy or natural Reaſon ſuggeſt unto us, but ſuch as he hath declared in his Word, for he is a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Cauſe of all, whoſe Ways and Methods we ought to obſerve, and be guided by, in our Religion, for<note n="†" place="margin">

                  <hi>he works all things according to the counſel of his own will, and according to the good pleaſure of his will:</hi> Yet this Holy Myſtery is a ſtumbling-block unto the <hi>Jews</hi> and unto the <hi>Greeks</hi> fooliſhneſs, and both look upon it as Hereſie, though if God's Word be the Word of Truth, this, as we hope to ſhew, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the True, Sound Doctrine, becauſe grounded upon it, though unſound Men will neither believe it nor conſent about it to the Faith of the Primitive Church and Orthodox Doctors of all Ages nor to the Confeſſions of Faith of all Chriſtian Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as if the Spirit of God and of Truth was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from them All, to be only amongſt <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Second Subſtances do exiſt only in the Firſt, Man in general exiſteth only in <hi>James, John,</hi> that are indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual, and Words are what Uſe makes them; an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſible and moſt ſingle Eſſence abſtractively conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, may and doth concretively exiſt in Three Perſons; no Man may well ſay, that an infinite Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence doth not admit of three <hi>Modes</hi> or Manners of Subſiſtence, but he only which fancies within his ſhallow and finite Intellect, to underſtand perfectly an infinite Nature with her Modes of ſubſiſting, which to pretend to, implieth Abſurdity and Impiety: And to affirm that to be One in relation to its Eſſence, and many as to the <hi>Modes,</hi> is no more contradictory, than to ſay the ſame Man is real in reſpect of his <hi>Eſſence,</hi> and modal as to his <hi>Subſiſtence;</hi> wherefore they who would terminate an infinite Eſſence only to one man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſubſiſting, ſo that it may not be communicated to another Perſon; either they underſtand not what an infinite Nature is, or elſe miſTake the meaning of the word <hi>Terminate</hi> or Confine, which is not to preſcribe limits, for that an infinite Nature doth abhor; but
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52204:34"/>the meaning is, that an Eſſence as may be the Father's, is ſo the Father's Eſſence, as may not be the Son's in the ſame manner, but it may be in a different way.</p>
               <p>Upon this Matter, it ought carefully to be obſerved how the Divine Eſſence is conſidered either <hi>Abſolutely</hi> or <hi>Relatively</hi> to the manner of exiſting; in reſpect to both, the Father is of himſelf, in relation to the <hi>firſt,</hi> the Son alſo is of himſelf, but as to the <hi>ſecond,</hi> he is from the Father, ſo is the Holy Ghoſt of himſelf in reſpect to the firſt, that is abſolutely conſider'd, but as to the ſecond, he proceedeth from both Father and Son: Wherefore the Father is abſolutely <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſelf God, becauſe both as to his Eſſence and as to his Perſon he is not from another, but the Son and Holy Ghoſt are alſo Self God, though not as to the Perſon, the Son being begotten by the Father as the Holy Ghoſt proceedeth from both; but as to the Nature, becauſe both are by that Eſſence which is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by another, or depend upon another, but that ſame which of it ſelf and by it ſelf, doth exiſt from all Eternity; the Three Perſons have but One and the ſame Eſſence, and they are not eſſentially diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed. The Son is from the Father by Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not as to his Eſſence, but in relation to his Perſon; not abſolutely as God, but relatively as Son, for the Son hath the ſame Nature and Subſtance as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Self God as he, though not in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; the Father may not be called <hi>Eſſentiator,</hi> if I may ſo ſay, of the Son or Holy Ghoſt, nor theſe <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiated,</hi> the Son is God of himſelf, though not Son of himſelf; the manner whereby theSon is ſaid to be from the Father is in Scripture deſcribed by the word Generation, which is nothing elſe but a Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one and the ſame Eſſence or Life that is Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Indiviſible, as expreſſed <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.7. and <hi>John</hi> 5. v. 26. which are not to be confounded with, nor mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by phyſical Generation, there being neither pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority nor poſteriority of Duration, no mutation or paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from Power to Act, from a not Being to a Being, from a diviſion and multiplication of Eſſence, from a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52204:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>formal Reaſon of active and paſſive Generation, from a dependency of him that is begotten upon him that hath begotten, or from a greater to the leſſer; ſo there is no ſuch Imperfections as are in Natural and Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical in which are priority and poſteriority of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, though not of Time: So there is no Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to be drawn out of one for the other; thus though a natural begetter doth efficiently beget of himſelf, materially from himſelf, terminatively out of himſelf, no ſuch thing is to be conceived of this Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of the Son of God, for though in Human Things the begetter and the begotten do ſometimes differ in the <hi>genus,</hi> ſometimes in the <hi>ſpecies</hi> or kind; in Divine Things they differ only in the <hi>modus</hi> or manner: This Generation is without any Motion, hath no beginning nor ending, becauſe he that begets and he that is begotten are Coeternal.</p>
               <p>What we ſay of the Son, may be affirmed of the Holy Ghoſt, who is from the Father and from the Son by way of proceſſion, not as to the Nature but as to the Perſon, for the Eſſence and Self-being of the Holy Ghoſt is juſt the ſame with that of the Father and of the Son, he is Self-God Actually though not Originally, Eſſentially though not Perſonally. Now theſe Three Perſons of the Godhead are diſtinguiſhed by their Names, Orders, Attributes and Workings, which Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions do not prejudice either the Unity or Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Eſſence, for it is not compoſed of Perſons, which are not before it, either in Time or Order, but, every one hath the whole Eſſence; neither can the Perſons be ſaid to be compoſed of the Eſſence, becauſe it is not before the Perſons, neither doth the manner of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting induce any Compoſition into the Eſſence, only a Diſtinction, and is ſaid to modificate not to multiply it: Now the <hi>modus</hi> or manner is here improperly taken, for commonly 'tis poſterior to the Subject it doth modifie: But in this, it is not ſo, there is not in the Perſons of the moſt Holy Trinity ſuch a real Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction as is between Things and Things, for the Perſon is not a different Thing from the Divine Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52204:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>but 'tis the very Eſſence with the manner of ſubſiſting.</p>
               <p>In ſome natural Things the manner of them is hard, and ſometimes impoſſible to be underſtood: Can a Man upon ſure Grounds find out how Graſs and Corn grows? How the Wind is formed? Whence it comes and whither it goes? and ſeveral ſuch things in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; we no ways doubt but that there are in the World thoſe who pretend to know all things, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for moſt things to give Reaſons, ſuch as they are, But can a Man know how he himſelf was made and formed? How his Soul came to be united to his Body? This Ignorance in common Matters we daily ſee and feel to be in our ſelves; and what muſt it be in thoſe Spiritual and High Ones which are ſuch as no Eye hath ſeen, nor Ear hath heard, nor ever entered into the Heart of Man, and which 'tis impoſſible for the Wit of Man to conceive; which Conſideration ſhould curb the Idle Curioſity of vain Men, who as with a little ſhort Line, would with their ſhallow Brains fathom the bottomleſs and unſearchable Depths of theſe adorable Myſteries, when with the Apoſtle<note n="*" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4.</note> that was caught up into Paradiſe, and heard unſpeakable Words, they ſhould cry out,<note n="†" place="margin">

                  <hi>a Will,</hi> and by this Will God according to his own Mind, applies his Power, where, when, and how he thinks good; and as his Underſtanding doth ſo his Will everlaſtingly works upon himſelf, as it hath no other Thing to work upon but it ſelf, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth it ſelf in the Infinite Goodneſs which it know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in it ſelf, and that Delight which God or his Will hath in its own Infinite Goodneſs, produces a Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in God, which is the Holy Ghoſt, and that mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Love whereby the Father takes Delight in his Son, which is his own Image conceived by his Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Son likewiſe rejoyceth in his Father; now this Action of the Will when it is fulfilled, is Liking and Love, as when a Man looketh in a Glaſs, if he ſmiles, his Image doth ſo too, and if it takes De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in it, it takes the ſame in him, for they are both One, and from theſe Two doth reſult the Third, all Three are in One Face, of One Face, and but One Face: Thus if we will make uſe of our Reaſon in theſe Myſterious and Incomprehenſible Matters, we muſt ſtutter and ſtammer; wherefore the beſt is chiefly, and only to ſtand to, and depend upon the Revelation thereof that God hath made in his Word, beyond which. Men ought not to preſume, for in Matters of ſo High a Concernment to ſpeak true and certain Things there is ſome Danger of the contrary: Herein we can give no Examples, becauſe there is nothing like God; we have no natural Grounds and Principles poſitively to prove theſe Truths, all Compariſons from the Sun, the Soul, the Rain-bow, a Triangle; and of my ſpeaking as <hi>I,</hi> my <hi>Word,</hi> and my <hi>Breath</hi> are Three ſeveral Things different one from another, yet I am but One Man, and ſuch like lame Compariſons fall
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52204:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>very ſhort of Illuſtrating theſe Myſteries, if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not underſtand how Original Sin is propagated in us, ſeeing our Soul is not <hi>ex traduce,</hi> begotten by Parents, how much leſs can we comprehend that Infinite and Eternal Being of One God in Three Perſons.</p>
               <p>After this, is it not Juſt that Men ſhould own how the Trinity is a High Myſtery which falls not under Senſes, and is infinitely above our Underſtanding? rather to be believed than felt or underſtood, whereof the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation ought to be the ſufficient and only Rule, as when Scripture ſaith,<note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.7.</note> 
                  <hi>there are three in Heaven, the Father, the Word and Holy Ghoſt, and theſe three are one;</hi> I muſt not puzzle my Brain to know how this can be; thus when the Apoſtle revealeth there is to be a Reſurrection of the dead, when ſome Men will ſay,<note n="†" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.35, 36.</note> 
                  <hi>How are the dead raiſed up, and with what body do they come?</hi> This is the rational Man who will dive too far, the Apoſtle for his pains calls him a Fool, <hi>thou fool, that which thou ſoweſt is not quickned except it die;</hi> ſo in Matter of God's Decrees, <hi>thou wilt then ſay unto me why doth he yet find fault?</hi> The Apoſtle's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is,<note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52204:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>Things of Divine Concernment and of Deity it ſelf; in human and finite Things we conceive well enough how in the ſame Nature are many Perſons to whom it is communicated, but that that Nature is but one and the ſame, and that ſo many Individuals make but one Man in the kind no Mind can conceive; but in Men the Reaſon of the Multiplication is in the finite <hi>Individuals,</hi> which are not only diſtinct one from another, but alſo have their ſeveral Bounds, and that univerſal Nature is, as if it were, rented into ſo many Parts; but as God is Infinite, the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, the Infinite cannot ſo much as in thought be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, wherefore it muſt not be thought an abſurdity if in Divine Things there is no multiplicity of Gods as there is of Men in human Nature; but ſtill after this reaſoning I return within the Circle to conſult Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, more than to ſtretch our Reaſon, with <hi>Job</hi> let us ſay,<note n="†" place="margin">

               <p>In this Controverſie Three ſeveral things are to be taken notice of; <hi>firſt,</hi> The truth of the thing, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that there is a God, but One God and Three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, which to hold is neceſſary to our Faith. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the Explanation thereof relating to the Doctrine which we already have ſaid ſeveral things about, whereunto we now ſhall in part repeat, and in part add theſe few things: Divine Eſſence communicable to Three Perſons is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther multiplyed nor divided, as 'tis in Men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; for though their Natures be but one and the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52204:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſame in <hi>Species,</hi> yet 'tis different in Number, but in the Deity not ſo; for the ſame Nature in Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, is but one and the ſame in Number: in the Perſons is an order of origine, according to which proceedeth not Eſſence from Eſſence abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider'd, nor Perſon from Eſſence, nor one God from another God, but one Perſon from another Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and from other Perſons very God of very God; for the Three Perſons are One God, and every Perſon is perfect God; in every Perſon is to be conſider'd the common and the proper <hi>Mode;</hi> in God we may not conceive any thing beſides One Eſſence and Three Modes, whereby with the Eſſence are conſtituted Three Perſons, in theſe Perſons one is not before or after the other, only in order and manner of ſubſiſting, whatſoever is eſſential is common to the Three, and what is perſonal is proper to every one of the Three; the <hi>Mode</hi> or Perſonality is the Abſtract, but the <hi>Mode</hi> with the Nature is the Concret: Here is no Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, no <hi>Genus,</hi> no <hi>Species,</hi> no Difference, no ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic Unity in God, but an eſſential and individual Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The Difference of <hi>Hypoſtaſes</hi> or Perſons in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature is from the different relation and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Subſiſtence, which cannot be confounded. There are eſſential and relative Properties, the firſt belong to every Perſon, becauſe every Perſon hath the ſame Nature; but not the ſecond, whereby they are diſtinguiſhed one from another; the Son is not the Father, nor the Father the Son: This alſo is to be taken notice of, that a finite Nature is capable of Diviſion, which an infinite is not, or elſe it were not infinite; therefore in this, God's Nature admits of no Compariſon with any created one whatſoever.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Third</hi> thing to be obſerved in this Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie is, the <hi>Proof,</hi> not to be taken out of Nature or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but out of Scripture, of both Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaments; and herein we muſt be very cautious how we draw and preſs Conſequences from the Creature to the Creator, becauſe there is an infinite Diſparity and Diſproportion between them, as there is between a finite and an infinite Nature; this laſt filleth all when
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52204:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>the other is confined within narrow bounds; for the infinite, as we ſaid, being communicated, is neither divided, multiplied nor alienated: Scripture calls God, the True God, God's own and proper Son; yet <hi>Socinians</hi> have rather in the Chriſtian Religion to admit two Gods, whereof one is a made, feigned, titular God, than a plurality of Perſons in the Unity of Eſſence, which Opinion of theirs is really more abſurd than they would have the Truth we own to ſeem to be; becauſe it doth quite deſtroy divine Nature; for a made and ſecondary God, is abſurd and a mere Contradiction, as good as to ſay, God no God: This is a Notion borrowed from the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens who had their Semi-gods, that is Men, who in their life-time having done ſome great Actions, were after their death, by <hi>Apotheoſis,</hi> deifi'd and reckon'd among their gods: According to this fancy our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour may be ſuch a Heroe and God, as their <hi>Hercules</hi> was: This is their good Chriſtian Doctrine. The ground of their Error is, that they think the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Perſons doth multiply the Eſſence; alſo they make a Confuſion between being and the manner of it: And they ask us, why we do not rather multiply Eſſences in the plurality of the Perſons, than Perſons in the Unity of Eſſence? whereunto we anſwer, that we therein follow the Doctrine of the Holy Ghoſt in the word, and he who makes Three Eſſences doth alſo make Three Gods, but he that ſaith there is One divine Nature in Three Perſons doth not make Three Gods; now Scripture and Reaſon teach us there is but One God, and the ſame Scripture ſaith alſo, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt are but One God; and 'tis to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd how the word Father, when uſed alone, as 'tis in the Lord's Prayer, without relation to the Son, is, as well as that of God, common to the Three Perſons, but when it ſignifies a Perſon of the Trinity firſt in order, then 'tis relatively to the Son.</p>
               <p>Now the Plurality of Perſons in One divine Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is proved by Arguments drawn out of Five ſeveral Heads, whereof the <hi>Firſt</hi> doth conſiſt in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52204:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>clear Teſtimonies out of Scripture. <hi>Secondly,</hi> from the relatives or oppoſite Relations, as Father, Son, Spirit, to beget, to be begotten, and to proceed from the Father and from the Son. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing Properties, as Creator to the Father, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer to the Son, Sanctifier to the Holy Ghoſt. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> by peculiar Apparitions to be read in both the Old and New Teſtaments.

               <p>Here I muſt not omit for Proof of this great Truth, to bring in our Creed called the <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> as an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; I meddle not with the others, for the Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries will not own them, though they ever were by better, more Learned, more Pious and Sound in all Ages than they are, or I doubt can be: I know the World hath afforded ſome Men who out of a vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory, and to ſeem to be ſomething, through a tryal of their Parts, have attempted to enervate with their Criticiſms the Strength and Orthodoxy of theſe Creeds, but as to this, <hi>Socinians</hi> themſelves can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept againſt it, no more than they do againſt the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Word of God whence this is extracted; Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt are all Three named in the Creed, and as the Word God is expreſſed when joined with the Father, ſo 'tis underſtood of Son and Holy Ghoſt, thus I believe in God his only begotten Son, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in God the Holy Ghoſt, for to them it alſo doth belong, and as there we profeſs to believe in, that is, to put our whole Truſt and Confidence, not only in the Father, but alſo in the Son and in the Holy Ghoſt, ſo thereby we own and declare them to be God as the Father; and in the Lord's Prayer which is part of the Worſhip we render unto God, though we name but One that is the Father, yet we mean all, for the Word is taken Eſſentially, for Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, and not perſonally, only for the firſt Perſon, becauſe the whole Trinity are our Father in reſpect of Creation, Preſervation, and Redemption for every ſuch outward Work, as ſaid before, is common to the Three Perſons, and ſo we addreſs our Prayer to all Three.</p>

The Word God is either firſt and properly ſpoken of the True, Eternal God, or of the Creature, if of the Creature, then the Creature ſhall properly be called and properly be God, which is Blaſphemy; but if it be ſpoken of the High, True and Eternal God, then it muſt ſignify his Eſſence and Nature, ſeeing God is ſuch from all Eternity through the perfection of his Nature, not upon the account of any Dignity or Power different from his Nature; the Name of God if abſolute, denoteth his Nature and not any Office, but if it be relative, and ſignifieth only an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, then from Eternity God was not God. They would have the Word God without an Article, as we obſerved of the Word Lord, to ſignify thoſe that are Secondarily ſuch, but with an Article only the True God, both which Notions are falſe; for firſt, the True
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:52204:55"/>God is ſometimes denoted without an Article, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.6.12.13.18. ſo is the Inſcription of the<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>Though there be that are called Gods, many,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to us there is but one God;</hi> and by the Epithet <hi>True</hi> God is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from them; therefore when the Word God is ſpoken of the True God, 'tis not appellative or common, but proper, for if it were not ſo, God would not abſolutely be one, for that is common which belongs to many, and proper, that which belongs only to one, and the Name of one only thing muſt needs be proper, ſince Scripture teaches us there is but one God, the Name of God muſt needs be proper: and farther, when a Name doth of it ſelf belong to one, and to others in relation only to that ſame one, it muſt be accounted to be that one's proper Name; thus the Name of God of it ſelf belongs to God alone, not in relation to any thing elſe, but to others it belongs only in relation to the only True God; and as the Word God, ſpoken of the True God, is, as already ſaid, taken Eſſentially or perſonally, ſo is the Name Father either for the Eſſence of God or for the firſt Perſon of the Trinity; now the Perſon is taken either <hi>abſtractively</hi> or <hi>concretively,</hi> when
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:52204:56"/>we ſay the Word God is taken perſonally, we do not mean abſtractively or ſeparately from, but concretive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or joyntly with the Eſſence; ſo the Name Father is taken either eſſentially or perſonally, in the firſt manner when in the Lord's Prayer, we ſay, our Father, and perſonally when in the Creed we ſay, I believe in God the Father.</p>
               <p>Thus far we in theſe matters do agree with the Adverſaries that there is but One God, and that<note n="*" place="margin">

Now there is a Name of God proper, and another appellative; this is given to the Creatures, and 'tis either properly or figuratively; in the firſt Sence the Word is not always to be underſtood to be the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Being but a relative one, as when ſome Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth through Error and Idolatry, name to her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſome Divinity or other, in this Senſe <hi>God</hi> and <hi>People</hi> are relatives, ſo the Name God taken in the predicament of <hi>Relation</hi> and not in that of <hi>Subſtance,</hi> may properly be ſpoken of a Creature; thus I ſpeak properly when I ſay, <hi>Chamos</hi> is the God of the <hi>Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites,</hi> and <hi>Malcom</hi> of the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> but when I come to examine the Opinion of thoſe Nations, it is very true that they are the Gods of ſuch Nations, but 'tis not true that they are Gods in Nature and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, they are but erroneouſly look'd upon as Gods by ſuch Nations; ſo this is not a ſubſtantial and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Truth, only Relative, which the Adverſaries may not affirm of the Son and of the Holy Ghoſt, as being feigned and invented Gods between which the Word of God makes a difference,<note n="†" place="margin">1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.9.</note>

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:52204:58"/>not really belong to them; for in every Metaphor there is true and falſe in the manner of it; thus Chriſt is call'd the True Light; for though in a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical way he be a Light, that is, ſpiritually works the ſame Effect as a corporal Light doth bodily, in the like manner he is called a True Vine, becauſe that the Metaphor is truly proper to him; but here the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is not about the truth of Words taken metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically but properly; for when the word <hi>True</hi> is joyn'd to thoſe that are properly taken, then it ſignifieth the very Nature of the thing; ſo when the word <hi>true</hi> is joyned with that of <hi>God,</hi> it neceſſarily ſignifies the Nature of God; and whenſoever the Name of True God is given any thing, thereby is Divine Nature at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to it: This ſhews how <hi>Socinians</hi> do not own Chriſt to be the true God, becauſe, according to Scripture, there is but one true God, they deny him to be that only true God: When God is called the onely Maker of Heaven and Earth, and the onely true God, 'tis not ſaid only by way of Excellency, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring God with the Creatures, but we thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all others; for in thoſe places the only true God is oppoſed to falſe gods, in relation to which he is not called true by way of Eminency, but becauſe it is the truth; for they are true gods by no means, and the true God is ever oppoſed to falſe gods and Idols, wherefore called the Living God,<note place="margin">

               <p>Nay they grow worſe and worſe; for as they would not have him to have been a God from the beginning, ſo at laſt they will have him to ceaſe from being a God; for if Chriſt be called true God only by virtue of that Power he hath over Believers, and in that reſpect only to be worſhipped as true God, then after the laſt day he will be God no longer, for then he ſhall be deprived of that Power when he ſhall have deliver'd up the Kingdom unto God even the Father, which Text I ſhall elſewhere have occaſion to explain; ſo that he ſhall be reduced to the common condition of other Believers, and have no Advantage over any of them. O take notice what a God they make Chriſt to be, for every Believer could be ſuch a God: No Man of ſound mind can't but ſee ſuch an Abſurdity, Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Blaſphemy. Here farther we could ſhew, that as <hi>Socinians</hi> own not Chriſt to be true God, ſo they deny him to be true Man, becauſe, they ſay, the Body he had of the bleſſed Virgin is gone, under the notion, That Fleſh and Blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God: They alſo teach, the Soul of Man

Yet they would have the Father alone to be God, and that when the Name of God is abſolutely ſet down, it is to be underſtood only of the Father, not of the Son, nor of the Holy Ghoſt, ſo they conclude Father, Son and Holy not to be One God, to which purpoſe they wreſt ſome Scripture out of the Old and New Teſtament, which in due time we ſhall by the Grace of God take an occaſion to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; but becauſe the Adverſaries uſe their utmoſt pernicious Endeavours to oppoſe theſe Truths, we to make clear theſe moſt important Doctrines which our Faith is grounded upon, muſt ſomewhat more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large upon it, though we take notice of ſome things we ſaid before, or to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, We ſay God is a Name of the Divine Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence or Nature, as Man is of Human Nature, but whereof there is a different Reaſon from that of all Names of other Natures; for all Individuals are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder one from another, their Nature according to the mental Notion is one, but not really ſo, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in them, Nature is the <hi>ſpecies</hi> or kind which is predicated and ſpoken of every ſingular and individual Perſon as <hi>James</hi> is a Man, and of many too, as <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew, John</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> are Three Men, but as in God
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:52204:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Eſſence is but One in number, and not only in the mental Notion, but alſo is really and moſt ſimply One, though in Three Perſons, this Name of God is not predicated as a <hi>ſpecies</hi> of every Perſon. but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the priority or poſteriority of their Origin and Order, as thus, the Father is God, but unbegot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, the Son God, begotten, the Holy Ghoſt proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from both. Now if the Name God was as <hi>ſpecies</hi> ſpoken of the Perſons, it would follow that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhould make ſeveral Gods different in Number and Nature. <hi>Secondly,</hi> We ſay where the Name of God is abſolutely uſed, it doth not always as the Hereticks would have it, ſignify the Name of One of the Perſons, but ſometimes the Perſon and ſometimes the Nature; and herein lays their Miſtake, that they ſuppoſe the Name of God ever to be taken Perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the Compariſon is the cauſe of the Miſtake, for the infinite Eſſence is not multiplied as the finite, now when the Name of God is taken for the Perſon, either ſomething is added which gives a Notion of the Perſon, as when God is ſaid,<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28.</note> 
                  <hi>to have purchaſed the Church with his own blood,</hi> which is underſtood of the Son, or elſe the Perſons are compared among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and then the Name of God is taken for the Perſon of the Father, for becauſe the Father is the Spring of the Godhead in relation to the Order and Origin of the Perſons, ſo in the compariſon of the Perſons the Name of God is by Excellency attributed to the Father, eſpecially where mention is made of the Mediator, for whenſoever Chriſt ſpeaks himſelf, or is ſpoken of, as, and in the Perſon of the Mediator, he retains a middle degree between God and Man, and then by the Name of God is underſtood the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, When the Name of God is put inſtead of One Perſon, and it ſignifies One Father, then is thereby underſtood the Godhead which is common to Son and Holy Ghoſt, who are Author and Maker of all Creatures; for though the Son doth exerciſe the Office of Mediator, yet he hath not thereby loſt the Glory of the Divinity with the Father, neither is his Eſſence inferiour or ſecondary to the Father's or his
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:52204:62"/>Godhead <hi>Eſſentiated.</hi> Fourthly, When God's Name without any perſonal Attribute or Compariſon of one Perſon with the other, is ſimply, indefinitely and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely uſed, then it ſignifies the Divine Nature and Eſſence which is Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, One God. Beſides, in theſe Texts of Scripture where the Name of God is mentioned in oppoſition to falſe Gods or Creatures, it is by no means to be reſtrained to the Perſon of the Father only, but is indefinitely ſpoken of Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt; as for inſtance, if when the Law commands to adore One God, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alone, and not the Son is to be underſtood, it would follow that the Son who is to be adored, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother God; likewiſe when God calls himſelf the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he by this mark diſtinguiſheth himſelf from all falſe Gods, How then might it be ſaid of one Perſonal one, whether Father or Son?<note n="*" place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.22.</note> 
                  <hi>Who is great as thou art, who is like unto thee?</hi> for ſeveral of the <hi>Arians</hi> who denied the Conſubſtantiality or the Sameneſs of Nature, yet owned a <hi>likeneſs</hi> between Father and Son; and in the Prophets where God's Name is abſolutely taken, often it addeth an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Negative or Excluſive; but if the Name of God belongeth only to the Father, and if Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt be but One God and Saviour, and One Nature, it will follow that Son and Holy Ghoſt are excluded from Things attributed unto God, for 'tis ſaid of the True God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that he is the only God and Saviour, and that there is no other God beſides and without him. Moreover, ſeeing the Father alone is One God, and they own alſo the Son to be God, and the Holy Ghoſt to be God, though not that One God, then it follows there are Three Gods, which is Blaſphemy,</p>
               <p>Theſe Things being premiſed do afford Matter of anſwer to their Sophiſtical Cavils againſt this Truth, and ſo ſhew how the Word <hi>God</hi> abſolutely uſed in Scripture is to be underſtood, not only of the Father, but alſo of the Son and Holy Ghoſt, whence alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth the Myſtery of theſe Doctrines one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and they are ſo twiſted, that they ſtand or fall together: So, no wonder if under one Head we ſay
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:52204:62"/>ſomethings belonging to, and ſpoken of in another; here they form thus an Argument againſt us. The God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> whom the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ever adored, is that One God whom the Law and the Prophets ſpeak of, but the Father of Chriſt is that One God mentioned in the Law and the Prophets, therefore he is that One God; but the Argument concludes nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, we altogether grant it, the Father is the One God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for we do not ſay that there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother God, another Nature in the Father, than that ſame, which Law and Prophets call the only God, and God alone; and we on our part do Argue thus, <hi>The God of</hi> Iſrael <hi>is One God, but Chriſt is the God of</hi> Iſrael <hi>who appeared to the Fathers, and by whoſe Spirit the Prophets being inſpired, ſpoke; therefore Chriſt is that only God.</hi> For there is in <hi>Chriſt</hi> no other God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, no other Divine Nature, than what is in the Father, as the Father is One, ſo is the Son One God, and both together are One God in Nature: But if the meaning of their Argument be that of the Three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Trinity, only the Father, not the Son, nor Holy Ghoſt, is the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> then we deny their <hi>minor</hi> Propoſition, for out of Scripture the Son is the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> whom they adored, for not only under the Name of God they adored the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> whom they believed to be God, but even they made a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct mention of him in their Prayers, as we read when <hi>Jacob</hi> bleſſed <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Children. <hi>God before whom my Fathers Abraham and Iſaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life time to this day <hi>3</hi> the</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel <hi>which redeemed me from all evil, bleſs theſe Lads;</hi> and this is ſpoken of the true antient <hi>Jews,</hi> for as to thoſe that believed not when our Saviour himſelf ſpoke to them, who owned only the Father of Chriſt the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> for their God, we may ſay, they knew not the True God in a true manner, <hi>ſeeing</hi>

               <p>As to the uſe of the Name of God in Scripture, the remaining Evidences are reduced under two kinds, <hi>Firſt,</hi> In ſome the Name of God is abſolutely taken for God the Father. <hi>Secondly,</hi> In others is added an excluſive Particle which is by ſome joyned with the Name of God, and by others with the Things ſpoken of and attributed unto God. Out of the firſt, nothing may be deduced contrary to this Doctrine, for in all thoſe places by them quoted, which anon we ſhall mention, is a Compariſon of the Perſons, wherein the Name of God is properly attributed to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the account of Order and Origin, but 'tis inconſequent to ſay, that in every place where the Name of God is abſolutely taken, that is, without Compariſon of the Perſons, it is to be underſtood only of the Father, for in ſeveral places where the Word <hi>God</hi> is indefinitely ſet down, yet it is by no means to be reduced to the Father alone; as to the other ſort of Proofs wherein an excluſive Particle is expreſſed, that excluſive Particle relates to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and to every thing which by Nature is not God, whither they be things in Nature, as Sun, Moon and Stars which Heathens worſhipped as Gods, or elſe thoſe which are Effects of Man's fancy and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:52204:63"/>ſuch are ſeveral Idols by fooliſh Men wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped as Gods: wherefore, ſeeing the True and Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential God is oppoſed to thoſe which by Nature are not Gods, it follows that by the Word God may well be underſtood Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt; likewiſe though ſometimes mention be made only of One Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, we muſt not take it as if thereby the other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were excluded, but only that which by Nature is not God, and that this is a right Interpretation, it may well be proved out of ſeveral places of Scripture, as for Inſtance, when God ſaith by<note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>In a Third way Scripture ſpeaks of a Son of God, and of none elſe, thus the only begotten from all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, namely, our Bleſſed Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who is not Son according to the firſt manner, which being common to all Men, would make no difference between him and others, and bring him into a Croud of the whole Work of Creation; neither is

               <p>The high Names of God's Own Son, Only Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which in Scripture are given the Lord Jeſus, are not upon the account of his miraculous Conception in the Womb of the Virgin, as <hi>Socinians</hi> would have it, we confeſs therein God had a ſpecial Hand, and it was effected in an extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but this is not enough to entitle him to the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, which the Queſtion is now about, to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh him from all others in the World called Sons of God, as anon we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak of <hi>Adam</hi> had alſo a miraculous Birth, yet the Names of Only Begotten, and God's Own and Proper Son do not belong to him; in Chriſt's Conception and Birth, God did not concur materially, but efficiently with his Power, but not with his Subſtance, ſeeing Chriſt, as to the Fleſh, was not of any inviſible Seed of God, but of the<note n="†" place="margin">

               <p>As in Creatures 'tis a perfection to beget their <hi>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miles,</hi> or that which is like unto themſelves, that may not be denyed God; now as we cannot conceive a communicability of a Nature which is ſpiritual and <hi>ad intra,</hi> but by the two Faculties of Underſtanding and Willing, whoſe Operations are <hi>immanent,</hi> ſo it may well be ſaid, that there can be but two Proceſſions in God, one by way of Intellection, whereby the Son is begotten, who is called the Word, Wiſdom, and Image of the Father, and the other by way of <hi>Volition</hi> whereby is breathed the Holy Ghoſt, who for that reaſon is ſpecially called Love; and though the Son doth alſo underſtand himſelf, yet he begets neither himſelf nor another; for he underſtands himſelf not of a notional Intellection to generate, which belongs on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Father, but with a notional one which is common to the Father and to the Holy Ghoſt. This is ſaid not to prove our Faith, but only to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate that what we believe is not contrary to Reaſon, though it be above it; for all theſe matters, as I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd before, and as all Orthodox and learned Men that writ upon them are agreed, are to be grounded on Scripture, rather than upon human Reaſon.</p>
               <p>The chief part of our Comfort and Salvation lies in the Belief of this Doctrine; for as in Chriſt is but one Perſon, ſo there are two Natures whereby he is in a capacity of perfecting our Redemption, which otherwiſe he could not be in; we own he is called Son of God <gap reason="foreign">

To refute ſome Cavils of theirs, one thing more we are again to take notice of upon this matter, how the the word <hi>God</hi> is in Scripture ſometimes taken <hi>eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially</hi> for the moſt holy Trinity, and ſometimes <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally</hi> for one of the Perſons, as when 'tis ſaid<note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> Argument whereby Chriſt is proved to be God's natural Son is drawn from the word <hi>only begotten,</hi> which for greater confirmation is attributed to Chriſt in ſeveral<note n="*" place="margin">

Indeed the High Prieſt's Queſtion was a Snare laid for Chriſt; for though they ſought falſe Witneſſes, and many came, yet their Witneſs did not agree together, wherefore they ſought to have ſomething out of his mouth wherewith to accuſe him. The Queſtion was amongſt other things, grounded upon what our Saviour had ſaid of himſelf in the Fifth and Tenth Chapters of <hi>John,</hi> whether he was of the ſame Nature with God, and in Power equal with him, which is the ſame as to be natural Son of God, and of the ſame Eſſence, which he having affirmatively anſwered unto and ſaid he was, thereupon having gained their Point, they rent their Cloaths and ſaid, What need we any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Witneſſes, and upon this very Confeſſion he was accuſed, condemned, and executed: Hence I ask <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians,</hi> Did Chriſt ſpeak the truth when he ſaid he was the Son of God, one with him, or of the ſame Nature, and to him equal in Power? I farther ask, whether the High Prieſt and the reſt did not well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend this to be the true meaning of his words? If ſo, as certainly both are true; if <hi>Socinians</hi> had been in the place of the <hi>Jews,</hi> they would have uſed him as they did, and would do the like if ever it were in their power; for ſome of them, when they write and give a Character of our bleſſed Saviour's Perſon, they ſeem to take a pleaſure to ſay, he was by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate or Council of <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> condemned and executed for Blaſphemy, in that he had ſaid he was the Son of God: that he ſaid ſo, 'tis moſt true out of <hi>John</hi> 10.36. but I ask again, when the Lord ſaid ſo, did he ſpeak the truth or not? If the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:52204:72"/>truth, why do Men not believe him, that is in the ſenſe the Jews underſtood it, true, proper, natural Son of God, equal with God?

                  <hi>not underſtood from the foundations of the earth;</hi> here by Beginning is ſignified the Foundation of the Earth. The ſecond Thing I obſerve is this, the Word was with God, here is a perſonal Diſtinction between God and the word who was with God, as if he had ſaid, reſided till he was made Fleſh, and in reſpect to this Incarnation, he is ſaid to have come down from the Father. The third Thing obſerved is this, <hi>the word was God,</hi> the Perſon called the Word, as it appears by the Article, is the Subject here called and aſſerted to be God, that is in the ſame eſſential Senſe, as the God with whom the word Was is ſaid to be God, that is by Nature, for as in this Verſe, but one <hi>Word,</hi> though thrice named, is to be underſtood, ſo but one true <hi>God</hi> in Nature, though thrice named, is meaned in the place: Thus the Eſſentiality and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity of the word who is the Son with the Father, are here evidently ſet forth, but this is more at large ſet down in the next Reaſon.</p>
               <p>But a ſecond Reaſon is, that <hi>John</hi> makes the Word equal with God, when he ſaith, <hi>the word was with God,</hi> which hath a relation to his Eternity, it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways with God, for here not only he diſtinguiſheth the Perſons, but makes the Word equal with God the Father, he ſaith the Word that was in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was one, and God the Father whom he was
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:52204:75"/>with, another; the Perſons of the Son and of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were diſtinct indeed, but in making them Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eternal, he makes them Equal; for them to ſay that the word being with God ſignifies that the word was known to God, but not to Men, doth them no good; the knowledge of this doth comprehend the whole Myſtery of our Redemption which the Son who is in the Boſom of the Father hath revealed unto us; but to the thing, if this imported no more but that Chriſt was known to the Father, What could he thereby have more than we? No Prerogative at all, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Foundation of the World God knew us, and We were preſent with him: Chriſt was with the the Father, that is, had a real Exiſtence, did ſubſiſt in himſelf, which cannot be ſaid of us or of any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, wherefore the <hi>Word</hi> muſt need have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Incarnation.</p>

               <p>In Scripture we have ſeveral places which either do expreſs or imply two Natures in the Perſon of our bleſſed Lord and Saviour; the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> doth among others afford us Two very conſiderable, the firſt is this,<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.14.</note> 
                  <hi>Behold a Virgin ſhall conceive and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:52204:76"/>bear a Son and ſhall call his name Immanuel;</hi> this affords ſeveral things ſeriouſly, but now briefly to be thought upon; this Prophecy is a ſign given <hi>Ahaz</hi> King of <hi>Judah</hi> to Comfort him, when the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and of <hi>Syria</hi> came up againſt him, with a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that they ſhould not prevail, and that he might be confirmed and aſſured of the performance, he is bidden to ask a Sign, which he refuſing to do, gave for Reaſon, he would not tempt God, whereupon is made this Goſpel-Promiſe, which was performed at the time of the Conception and Birth of our bleſſed Saviour, whoſe Mother was a Virgin, and whoſe Name was <hi>Immanuel,</hi> a Name given him at that time by the Prophet through God's own appointment, and when the Angel delivered his Meſſage to <hi>Mary,</hi> he makes uſe of ſome of the Words of the Prophet,<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.31.</note> 
                  <hi>thou ſhalt conceive and bring forth a Son,</hi> and ſhalt call his Name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> becauſe he was to ſave his People; and when the thing was fulfilled, the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt doth point at, and quote this Prophecy, adding the Interpretation of the Name<note n="‖" place="margin">Matt. <hi>1.21.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Immanuel, God with us.</hi> So there is no doubt to be made that this wholly and only, related to our Saviour; never any other Virgin did conceive and bring forth, never was the Name <hi>Immanuel</hi> given any one elſe, and cannot be wreſted ſo, as to be given to any Son to be born of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> for ſome Reaſon which I preſently ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce; <hi>Immanuel</hi> is God with a Divine Eſſence, Chriſt is the <hi>Immanuel,</hi> ſo we muſt conclude he hath the Divine Eſſence, for God with us hath the Divine Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and God with us is <hi>Immanuel;</hi> the Name God is not ſpoken of Angels, of no King or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, of no Idols, which are the ſeveral ſignifications of the Word <hi>God</hi> uſed in Scripture; wherefore he whom this Name is given to, muſt be the true eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial God; and this ſame Evangelical Prophet in the next Chapter but one after this, calls him by the Name uſed in this place, and the Word <hi>El,</hi> which makes the latter end of the Name, doth not barely ſignify God, but the <hi>Mighty God;</hi> this Word makes part of that of <hi>Michael</hi> whoſe ſignification is, <hi>who is like unto thee, thou mighty God;</hi> and he that beareth it, is

               <p>As to that great incomprehenſible and adorable
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:52204:77"/>Myſtery of the Incarnation of the Second Perſon of the moſt Holy Trinity, whereby the Divine and Human Natures were mediatly, and the Perſon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly united to the Nature; 'tis to be obſerved, that 'tis not by a <hi>Conſubſtantial</hi> Union, ſuch as the Three Perſons of the moſt Holy Trinity are united one with another; neither is it a <hi>Subſtantial</hi> Union only by Eſſence and Vertue, as the Eſſence of Chriſt is preſent with every thing, not by <hi>a preſence of Grace</hi> only; not <hi>Phyſical</hi> as Form and Matter are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited, not as one Friend is united to one another, as the Soul of <hi>Jouathan</hi> was knit with the Soul of<note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.1.</note> 
                  <hi>David,</hi> not <hi>myſtical</hi> only or in the ſame manner as Chriſt dwelleth in Believers; not <hi>Sacramental</hi> as Chriſt is in the Bread and Wine of the Lord's Supper, but 'tis a <hi>Perſonal</hi> Union, and that without any Change of or in the Divine Perſon, without a renting of the Natures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> or Confuſion of the ſame againſt the <hi>Eutychians,</hi> alſo without any Change and Separation.</p>
               <p>Now I am upon this high Myſtery of the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the Evangeliſt expreſſed in theſe words, <hi>the word was made fleſh;</hi> I ſhall take notice of ſome few things: doth not the expreſſion which is parallel with this,<note n="†" place="margin">1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.2.</note> 
                  <hi>that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh,</hi> mean that Chriſt the <hi>Word</hi> was in being before he was made Fleſh or came in the Fleſh, and that this Being was according to the Spirit, which in Scripture is oppoſed to the Fleſh, and that he had a ſpiritual Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence before he took our human Nature ſignified by the word Fleſh? for according to Scripture, Fleſh ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies human Nature; ſo to be made Fleſh, to aſſume human Nature, let one place ſerve inſtead of many,<note n="‖" place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16.</note> 
                  <hi>by the works of the law ſhall no fleſh,</hi> that is, no Man <hi>be juſtified.</hi> The Son of God was firſt, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he was manifeſted; as, to make uſe of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon in a thing which admits none, in matters of God's Decrees, the Decree is before the Declaration of it, for the Decree is from all Eternity, but the Declaration only in time; what is ſaid of Chriſt,<note n="*" place="margin">Gal. <hi>4.4.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>that he was made of a woman,</hi> is conſiderable, for it implies that he was made Man, and took upon him our Nature, not out of the Subſtance of any
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:52204:77"/>Man, but only of a Woman; his Body was formed in the bleſſed Virgin's Womb, without any help of Man, ſo he became Man only by the Woman's ſide, but he was Son of God before he was made of a Woman, and he muſt need have had a Being before he was ſent forth, he was with God before God ſent him, which is oppoſed to his appearing and being manifeſted to the World,<note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>we ſhew unto you that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life which was with the Father, and was manifeſted unto us;</hi> he was with the Father, exiſted and had a Being, before he was manifeſted unto us, dwelt and pitched his Tabernacle among us; it is obſervable out of that place where it is ſaid of our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,<note n="†" place="margin">

                  <hi>he took on him the ſeed of Abraham;</hi> the word took in the Original ſignifies alſo to take and lay hold or caught hold as he did of ſinking <hi>Peter</hi> to ſave him from drowning, ſo he caught hold of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind when it was ready to ſink.</p>
               <p>Againſt this they ſay there can be no ſuch Union of Divine and Human Nature in one Perſon, but that ſuch an Union is not unpoſſible, it may be illuſtrated out of the Union of our Soul with our Body, which are of two different Natures, ſpiritual and material, inviſible and viſible, immortal and mortal; and tho' we cannot conceive the Reaſon, it ought to be no Prejudice, neither can we conceive the manner of their Union, which yet is true and certain; we moſt certainly believe ſome things to be, tho' we do not at all comprehend the manner of it; and altho' there be an infinite diſproportion between God and Man, yet that is no juſt Prejudice againſt the Union of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity with Humanity; with harbouring ſuch No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Men do too much meaſure God by themſelves, who becauſe they are evil are not capable of ſo much Goodneſs, and out of Pride are apt to ſay, ſo much Condeſcention becomes not God; but God knows better than we what becomes him, and what we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not comprehend of him we ought to admire and adore; God's Ways are not like our Ways, nor his Thoughts like our Thoughts; and tho' he condeſcends never ſo low, yet is ever ſure of his Greatneſs, which nothing can take away from him: This Humiliation or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:52204:78"/>is a wonderful Argument of God's Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is the greateſt Glory of Divine Nature; this is cauſe of Thankfulneſs, not of Cavils and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions; he knows what is beſt and fitteſt for him to do, and wants not our Counſel; had the Son of God appeared as a great Prince, he probably would thereby have made more Hypocrites than real Converts, and not ſo well perſuaded Men to Holineſs and Goodneſs, for Arguments to do it muſt not be fetch'd from the Pomp and Proſperity of this World, but from the great Rewards and Glory of that which is to come. But before I leave this Point I muſt take notice of that place wherein the Apoſtle makes the Son of God upon his coming into the World ſpeak thus,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5.</note> 
                  <hi>but a body haſt thou prepared me;</hi> the Body was prepared againſt his coming into the World, and that prepared Body at his coming he took, ſo then he was before the Body was prepared for him, and before his coming into the World, for nothing can be ſaid to be ſitted, as the word implies in the Original, for one who is not; hence we conclude how the Son of God was before his Incarnation and had a Being; but we now return to our Proofs.</p>

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:52204:78"/>Prophet though he had named a Child and a Son, ſpeaks in the ſingular number, <hi>his</hi> Shoulder, <hi>his</hi> Name, <hi>his</hi> Government; as his Name is wonderful, ſo is the manner of the Union, theſe two Natures are in one Perſon without Confuſion, the Divine retained her Proprieties, ſo hath the Human, and yet theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Proprieties are ſo united in one Perſon, that the Perſon may be called by the Name of both Natures; Chriſt is God; and Chriſt is Man in the <hi>Concret,</hi> tho' in the Abſtract, it may not be ſaid Divinity is Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, nor Humanity Divinity, they are united, but without Confuſion.</p>

Beſides, this Expoſition of theirs, they can bring no Example to confirm it; for in abundance of places we read <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be called Son of God, but find none at all wherein he is called Son of God according to the Fleſh: And the Angel doth not ſay, therefore he may happen to be, but abſolutely and publickly declareth he ſhall be called; wherefore ſeeing he no where is called Son of God according to the Fleſh, we may neceſſarily conclude he is not ſuch in that ſenſe; to be called is sometimes really to be as in that Text<note n="*" place="margin">1. <hi>John</hi> 3.1.</note>, <hi>Behold what manner of love the Father hath beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, that we ſhould be called the Sons of God,</hi> that is, that we ſhould really be owned and declared to be the Sons of God, ſuch as truly we are, being adopted in Chriſt his true natural Son.</p>
               <p>The word <hi>holy,</hi> uſed, gives a ſtrong Evidence that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was to be called Son of God for a much better and higher reaſon than that he was to be born of a
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:52204:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>Virgin; he ſhall be called Son of God becauſe he is holy, therefore not upon the account of the Fleſh, but by reaſon of his Holineſs, becauſe the Holy Ghoſt coming upon the Virgin, ſome holy thing was to be born of her; that makes the Angel ſay, <hi>Therefore alſo that holy thing which ſhall be born of thee, ſhall be called the Son of God;</hi> not as to the manner of Conception, but as to the thing to be conceived, though by the Angel it be not expreſſed; how great was that Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, we may well conceive it to be that higheſt and infinite Holineſs as becomes the Son of God; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Iſaiah</hi> in his Prophecy of him, calls him, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready obſerved, the <hi>mighty God; Elizabeth</hi> calls him<note place="margin">

                  <hi>and</hi> or <hi>alſo</hi> which follows <hi>therefore,</hi> is not in vain, but ſhews a Compariſon, and is related not to the word <hi>called</hi> but to <hi>be born,</hi> and the ſenſe is, not only that <hi>word</hi> which from Eternity is born of God is Son of God, but that holy thing which ſhall be born of thee, ſhall be called the Son of God, becauſe that eternal Son of God ſhall take human Nature, and be born of thee: And this is one of the things which the Holy Ghoſt coming upon the Virgin was to do, namely, that ſhe ſhould conceive without Man, and conceive a Man, him who from eternity is according to divine Nature the Son of God, which could not otherwiſe be effected than with the Holy Ghoſt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting human Nature, which was to be formed out of her own Blood and Subſtance, ſanctified before and preſerved from Sin and Corruption, with the Perſon of the Son: Men muſt not think there is in Scripture the leaſt tittle or word without cauſe, for the Holy Ghoſt doth and ſaith nothing in vain.</p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:52204:82"/>
               <p>Another reaſon is, the Angel ſaith, <hi>Chriſt ſhall be called the Son, not of the Holy Ghoſt, but of God the Father:</hi> Now if the manner of this Conception was the cauſe of his being called Son of God, he ſhould properly be the Son of the Holy Ghoſt, not of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for he is ſaid to be <hi>conceived by the Holy Ghoſt</hi> (but they deny the Holy Ghoſt to be a Perſon, yet <hi>actiones ſunt ſuppoſitorum,</hi> is a Rule in Philoſophy) and this Conceiving being an Act, the Holy Ghoſt muſt be a Perſon; for I defie them to ſhew any thing to be done but by a Perſon. Scripture in the quoted place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.3. the Queſtion being about Chriſt's being the Son of God, excludes the Fleſh to attribute it to the Spirit; but <hi>Socinians</hi> would have it according to both, yet S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſcope is to teach how he is Son of God according to the Fleſh, and how according to the Spirit; as to the firſt, he explains himſelf when he ſaith, <hi>which was made of the ſeed of</hi> David; as to be ſecond, he declareth his meaning when he ſaith, <hi>he was declared Son of God with power,</hi> whence we may conclude he ſaith <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be called and really be the Son of God, not according to the Fleſh, but to the Spirit, or elſe he had not ſufficiently declared in what ſenſe he is the ſon of God; and 'tis clear how he oppoſes the Fleſh to the Spirit; according to the firſt he was made of the Seed of <hi>David,</hi> according to the laſt he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the Son of God.</p>

Now, I ſay, it were in vain in Scripture to ſee ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten mention made of Chriſt's Fleſh, if there was in him no other thing as the ground of the Diſtinction; thus when we ſpeak of Man's Body, 'tis to diſtinguiſh it from the Soul; ſo of his Soul to diſtinguiſh it from the Body; for though in one Man there be Soul and Body, yet the Soul is not the Body, nor the Body the Soul: So in Chriſt, though he be but one Perſon, yet that Perſon conſiſteth of divine and human Natures, one expreſſed by Spirit the other by fleſh, a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Diſtinction to make us know which Nature in him is ſpoken of, for they ought not to be confounded, each having its proper Attributes.</p>
               <p>But as their way of arguing is altogether Cavils and Sophiſtries, ſo they would put a falſe Gloſs upon our Saviour's fore-quoted words, <hi>That which is born of the Fleſh is Fleſh, &amp;c.</hi> as if he were ſpeaking of that which is naturally done, but Chriſt's Conception and Birth is ſupernatural; but ſee what a wrong Principle they go upon, for the Conception by the Spirit they reckon to
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:52204:84"/>be natural, as if the Spirit of God beſtowed upon us in a ſpiritual Generation or Regeneration was natural to us, when 'tis a ſupernatural Gift of divine Grace: Now ſeeing the Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> according to the Fleſh, is not born of any ſpiritual but a carnal Matter, he is not properly born as of a Seed, and ſo may not be called Son of God according to the Fleſh, though through the Operation of the Spirit he was born of fleſhly Matter: But, that one may properly be ſaid to be born of the Spirit, 'tis not enough to have the Holy Ghoſt be the Author of his Birth, but alſo he muſt be born of ſpiritual Seed, to the end there may be a Proportion betwen a ſpiritual and a carnal Birth, or elſe if to have one to be properly born of God, it be enough for God to create a carnal Seed, then it would follow that all things which at firſt were created out of the Earth and Water through a Production of Seeds by God, might be ſaid to be properly born of God, which is abſurd; ſo that after that manner, Chriſt may not be ſaid to be properly born of God, and be his Son.</p>
               <p>The Knowledg of this matter is of ſo high a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, that I muſt ſomewhat more enlarge upon't: <hi>Socinians</hi> would have Chriſt to be truly and properly Son of God according to the Fleſh, becauſe, ſay they, God acted the part of a Man; but we ſay, how, to the end one may, in point of Generation, act the part of a Man, it is not enough to afford any matter of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, but it is neceſſary it be out of his own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; for if he affords another and foreign Matter, that which is born may upon the account of ſuch Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by no means be called his Son, nor be ſaid to be born of ſuch a one, becauſe he is not of his own Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Subſtance, neither may he be accounted to be true Father to one ſo born; he that is not born of the Fleſh and Blood of a Man, may not be called ſuch a Man's proper Son: Certainly if a Woman ſhould beget a Son of anothers and not of her own Subſtance, ſhe might not be called his true Mother, for ſhe communicated nothing unto him: By the ſame reaſon one may not be called a true Father who is Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Generation not of his own Body and Subſtance, but of another's; to be a true Son one muſt be begotten
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:52204:84"/>not only by the Father but alſo of the Father, by the Father efficiently, and of the Father in ſome manner materially, that is, either of the Father's own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or out of that which is derived therefrom. Hence it appears how in the Generation of Chriſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Fleſh, the Father acted not properly the part of a Man, becauſe he communicated not his own Subſtance, but made uſe of that of another; wherefore Chriſt may not, according to the Fleſh, be properly and abſolutely called Son of God, but only <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> and in ſome reſpects, as <hi>Adam</hi> by God formed out of Clay is indeed called<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 3.38.</note> 
                  <hi>Son of God,</hi> but improperly, for he was not begotten in the manner of a Son; ſo Chriſt, according to the Fleſh, muſt not properly be called Son of God, not being begotten of God's Subſtance in the manner of a Son; to be proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Father is not to ſupply the part of a Father, as <hi>Socinians</hi> ſay, but really to beget of his own Subſtance, or elſe he may not properly be called ſuch a ones Son. Our Saviour indeed, as to his human Nature, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly <hi>Mary's</hi> Son, becauſe begotten of her Subſtance; but in this Generation of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> God ſupply'd indeed the part of a Man, as much as relateth to the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Generation of a Man, but not as to the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Son; ſo that in relation to God it may be called a Production rather than a Generation: A Man by God's Will may be made of nothing, or of any matter, but a Son being a Relative to the Father, with whom he hath a Conſanguinity and Unity of Blood, he muſt be formed of the very Subſtance of his Father. To ſay that God created a new Matter in the <hi>Virgin's</hi> Womb, is to talk at random, without the leaſt ground for it in Scripture, neither was it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; for God could out of the Virgins Blood have cauſed a perfect Generation of a Man: Wherefore we conclude, that ſince Chriſt is called God the Father's proper and own Son, he muſt be begotten of God the Father's own and proper Nature and Subſtance.</p>
               <p>Hence we do alſo infer, that the Name of Son of God ſignifies ſome eſſential thing in Chriſt, and not an Office and Dignity, as appeareth out of the <hi>Acts</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 8.37.</note> 
                  <hi>I believe,</hi> ſaith the Eunuch, <hi>that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:52204:85"/>of God;</hi> for if to be Chriſt and Son of God ſignifieth the ſame thing, then the words would contain this <hi>Tautology,</hi> that Chriſt is Chriſt; but upon this ſolemn occaſion of his being about to be baptiſed, in anſwer to what <hi>Philip</hi> had ſaid, that he is to be baptized in the Name of Chriſt, ſo he muſt make a declaration that he believes in Chriſt, and of what he believes him to be, namely the Son of God; ſo that the Name Son, is not the Name of an Office, as that of Chriſt, but the Name of the Perſon that exerciſeth that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as good as if he had ſaid, This Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt preached to me, is not to be conſider'd only as the Son of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> who dyed and was crucified, but alſo as the Son of God who liveth for ever: To be Chriſt and to be the Son of God is not the ſame thing, but different relations; the <hi>Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> hath a relation to a Father, as the <hi>Patornity</hi> hath to a Son; but the relation of the word <hi>Chriſt</hi> is either to God who<note n="*" place="margin">

                  </note> he <hi>is made King:</hi> So then, according to the formal Reaſon, Son of God and Chriſt do not denote the ſame thing, neither could Chriſt by virtue of his Office, which he received but in time, be properly called Son of God and equal with God, as it appears<note n="‖" place="margin">

But to return to our Text, hence appeareth the inſignificancy of their Exceptions; for all the Evangeliſts do joyn the Names of Chriſt and Son of God: And we are to take ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial notice, how after our Saviour had affirmed he was the Son of God, they all concluded he had blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, which there had been no cauſe for them to ſay, except thereby had been meaned he who is begotten of the Eſſence and Nature of God, and therein equal with him.</p>

Thus though the Words Son of God and Chriſt belong to one and the ſame Perſon, yet in themſelves they differ one from another, as do God and Lord, which in Scripture are often joyned together as <hi>the Lord God,</hi> and put one for another, yet God is a Name of Nature, and Lord ſignifies his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, they in themſelves denote different things, thô pertaining to one and the ſame Subject, or elſe every Lord were a God; thus a Husband were a God unto his Wife, becauſe <hi>Sarah</hi> called <hi>Abraham</hi> her Lord, the Lord of the unfaithful Servant were his God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he calls him his Lord, the Lord of the Vineyard were the God of the Vineyard, becauſe called it's Lord, and many more ſuch Inſtances: And I ſhall illuſtrate the thing by a trivial Saying among us, <hi>A Servant may ſay, his Maſter is Lord, but not God, at home.</hi>

Withall after this <hi>Socinian</hi> way of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing, it would follow in this Text, that the Names <hi>Chriſt, Father,</hi> and <hi>Son,</hi> do ſignifie the ſame; for here the Apoſtle offereth two Propoſitions, the <hi>firſt,</hi> He is a Lyar that denyeth Jeſus to be the Chriſt; the <hi>laſt,</hi> He is Antichriſt that denyeth the Father and the Son. The Adverſaries make them both equivalent, for in

               <p>But becauſe Chriſt, to prove himſelf to be the Son of God, ſpeaks to the Jews about his Sanctification by the Father, which Sanctification is the anointing ſpoken of by <hi>Peter</hi>

                     <hi>Acts</hi> 10.38.</note>, wherefore they would have that to be the cauſe of his being Son of God; but if there was no other reaſon of that divine Filiation but the Sanctification and Anointing, then the cauſe by the Angel given in<note n="‖" place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 1.35.</note> Scripture were falſe. So then Chriſt is called the Son of God not only upon the account of his extraordinary Birth and of his kingly Office, as <hi>Socinus</hi> ſaith, but for being of the ſame Nature and Eſſence with the Father, which that Text of <hi>John</hi> 10. is not againſt; for in that place our Saviour doth not give in the cauſe why he is Son of God, but only goes about to refute the Slander of Blaſphemy by the Jews caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, not by an Argument <hi>à pari,</hi> taken from equal things, but from the leſſer to the greater: He had ſaid <hi>v.</hi> 30. <hi>I and my Father are one,</hi> thereby expreſly aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his <hi>Conſubſtantiality</hi> and Oneneſs of Nature with the Father, whereupon they took Stones to ſtone him, becauſe of that pretended Blaſphemy, <hi>in that he being man made himſelf God,</hi> which Objection he anſwereth with an Inſtance from leſs to greater.

               <p>OF God's Attributes ſome are Negative, as Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, Independent, Immortal, Unchangeable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which remove from God all manner of Imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and though theſe teach not what he is, yet they teach what he is not; others are Affirmative, as Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, Almighty, All-knowing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> theſe are not ſo ſtrong as the others, becauſe they repreſent Things but imperfectly; other Attributes there be, as Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Goodneſs, Mercy, Juſtice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which in ſome Degree God is pleaſed to impart unto the Creature, but theſe I intend not to ſpeak of, only of thoſe that are eſſential and incommunicable to the Creature; and this Rule muſt be laid, that whenſoever any of theſe Attributes are in Scripture given to God eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally taken, they are attributed to Chriſt, becauſe he is eſſentially God, as I hope is ſufficiently proved.</p>
               <p>But before I proceed, ſomething in general may be ſpoken about Divine Attributes. The Attributes of God are thoſe Proprieties whereby he makes himſelf known unto us, and ſhews the Difference that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and the Creature; theſe Attributes in God are not as Attributes in the Creatures, for they are no Qualities nor Accidents, nor Things different from the Eſſence, or from one another according to the Rule that nothing is in God but what is God himſelf; God's Infiniteneſs and Eternity, are God Infinite and Eternal; wherefore becauſe we cannot comprehend God's Infiniteneſs, Eternity, Simplicity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we ſay we cannot comprehend his Eſſence and Nature. The Knowledge that is in us, comes in by Parts and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, How then can we know one Attribute of God
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:52204:91"/>as may be his Simplicity and Abſoluteneſs which hath no Parts? For it doth not conſiſt of any <hi>Genus</hi> and <hi>Difference, Subſtance</hi> and <hi>Accident, Power</hi> and <hi>Act,</hi> nor of <hi>Ens,</hi> being and <hi>Eſſence;</hi> and as to his Immenſity or Infiniteneſs according to which he is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, wholly, whole, whole in himſelf, whole in all, whole in every one, and whole out of all; he is neither circumſcrib'd, defined by, included in or excluded out of any place; all theſe are paſt Underſtanding, not only of Men, but of Angels alſo. Let thoſe who pretend to know all Things, and that to them nothing is a Myſtery, take notice of this: Thus much in ſhort of the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable Attributes, or as otherwiſe called of the firſt Order. And as to thoſe of the ſecond and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable to Creatures which yet muſt be well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, for a thing may be ſaid to be imparted or communicated in two ways, either when the ſame thing in Number and Species is imparted to another, or when the ſame is by <hi>Analogy</hi> in likeneſs and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion. In the firſt way, no propriety of God can be communicated to the Creature, becauſe all infinite and the ſame with the Nature, but in the laſt in ſome meaſure and degree they are, in as much as ſome Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects like unto his Attributes according to their Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city come out of them.</p>
               <p>The Attributes of this laſt ſort may be reduced under theſe three Heads Mercy, Wiſdom and Power; Mercy moveth and willeth, Wiſdom doth contrive and diſpoſe, and Power executes, all three in God In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and Eternal, all three to be found in the Son in the Works of Creation, Preſervation and Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; in relation to the two firſt abſolutely conſider'd, in his Divine Nature, and to the laſt in both Divine and Human in the Capacity of Mediator, wherein he is both God and Man, for indeed the Office of Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor required a Perſon that ſhould be both, to perform thoſe things that were to be done in relation to both; becauſe to ſuffer and die was the part of human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which the Divine is not capable of, but to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Death and our ſpiritual Enemies, could not be effected but by a Divine Power; withal it became
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:52204:92"/>the Majeſty of God, that the Mediator ſhould be God, for that Majeſty is ſo great that none but one that is intimate and equal with the Father, could interpoſe between God and Man: Angels themſelves could and dared not undertake it, for they ſtood in need of Chriſt to be confirmed in their ſtate of Integrity; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, they are not pure in God's ſight, much leſs any Man meerly ſuch. I ask, Who but a God could deſtroy ſin, appeaſe God's wrath overcome the Power of Satan, with natural and eternal Death? Who could make expiation for Offences committed againſt an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite God, but he that is Infinite himſelf? By whoſe Interceſſion could God's Anger be pacified, but thorough him that is his beloved Son? By whoſe Power could Satan and the whole Power of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be overcome but by him that is ſtronger than all Devils and Hell? And who could conquer Death, but he that hath deſtroyed him who hath the Power of Death? And as none but a God could deliver us from all theſe Evils, under whoſe Power we were; ſo none but a God could reſtore us to the Goods we had loſt; Who could have reſtored us to a perfect Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, but he that is Righteouſneſs it ſelf? Who to God's Image, but he that is the expreſs Image of his Perſon, and the Brightneſs of his Glory? Who could make us Children of God, but he that is his natural, only begotten and beloved Son? Who could beſtow upon us the Holy Ghoſt, but he from whom the Holy Ghoſt proceedeth? And who could give us eternal Life, but he that is Life it ſelf? And by whom could we come to God, but thorough <hi>him that is the way?</hi> Out of all this it appears how none but a True and not a made God, could be a Mediator between God and us.<note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.25.</note> 
                  <hi>If one man ſin againſt another,</hi> ſaith <hi>Eli, the judge ſhall judge him; but if a man ſin againſt the Lord, who ſhall intreat for him?</hi> No meer Man can, only he that is Lord God himſelf.</p>
               <p>Divine Eſſence is neceſſarily attended with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Attributes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.</note> and it being moſt ſimple, they are not otherwiſe diſtinguiſhed then after our manner of Conceiving, ſo that out of the foregoing Evidences
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:52204:92"/>they muſt neceſſarily be attributed unto the Son; and firſt Eternity; having already proved Chriſt's Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and his eternal Generation, we have ſpoken many Things belonging to this Head: Eternity is Indiviſible, as the begetting Power of the Father is Infinite, ſo it hath a <hi>terminus</hi> an Object of Infinite Perfection, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his Son <hi>Coeternal</hi> and <hi>Coeſſential,</hi> and becauſe the Generation is from Eternity, ſo is it true that the Son was continually and perpetually begotten, for we muſt not ſay God was firſt God and then Father, but without beginning always God and always Father; and ſeeing he ever was Father, he ever had a Son: This Reaſon is much to our purpoſe, and we could eaſily farther enlarge upon it; yet in order to prove this Eternity, we muſt draw Arguments out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, without which in theſe Matters, all our Reaſons are no Reaſons at all.</p>
               <p>Both Teſtaments do abound in Proofs, but out of many we ſhall make uſe of few: Firſt out of the Old, and begin with the place where it ſpeaks of Chriſt's Kingdom, and of the Glory and Power there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. He ſaith,<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3.</note> 
                  <hi>From the womb of the morning thou haſt the dew of thy youth;</hi> the Meaning and Sence of the Words is, thou art from Eternity, Morning im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a Day, and the firſt part of it too, Day imports a Time which began with the Creation; for before, there was no Time, all was Eternity; now Chriſt whom here <hi>David</hi> calls his Lord, is not ſaid to have the Dew of his Youth from the Morning, but from the Womb of the Morning, that is, before there was any Morning, any Time at all; for before any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be brought forth, 'tis in the Womb, and what is the Womb of Time but Eternity, which is the Day ſpoken of in another place,<note n="†" place="margin">Pſal. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>this day have I begotten thee;</hi> with God there is no Time, with Him all is one Day, a Day of Eternity; that ſaying ſo to him, is not of a preſent Generation or Conſtitution, but the Revelation of a Thing that was before; wherefore in that ſame Verſe it is called a Decree, <hi>I will declare the decree;</hi> 'tis the declaration of the Decree, not the time of it; now all God's Decrees are Eternal without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:52204:93"/>conſequently the Time therein mentioned is meaned of Eternity, which the Pſalmiſt's manner of ſpeaking doth confirm more, when in that firſt place he ſaith, <hi>thou haſt the dew of thy youth;</hi> the Dew falls on the firſt part of the Morning, ſo in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Time he had not his Birth or Childhood, but his Youth not only exiſted, but had his whole Strength and Vigour; all this way of ſpeaking is with condeſcending to our weak human Capacity, to make us underſtand how the Perſon therein ſpoken, is from Eternity, as 'tis plainly expreſſed by<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.21, 22, 24, 25.</note> 
                  <hi>Solomon,</hi> when bringing the ſame Perſon to ſpeak under the Name of Wiſdom, ſaith, <hi>the Lord poſſeſſed me in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his ways, before his works of old; I was ſet from everlaſting, from the beginning or ever the earth was, when there was no depths, when there was no foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains with water, and before the mountains were ſettled I was brought forth,</hi> that is, before there was any Creature; now that Chriſt is the Wiſdom of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note n="†" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30.</note> 
                  <hi>who of God is made unto us wiſdom,</hi> &amp;c. no Man ought to doubt of.</p>
               <p>Another Text to prove this Eternity, is one of the Names whereby the Prophet calls Chriſt when he fore-telleth his Birth in the place which we had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſpeak of before<note n="‖" place="margin">

A farther Proof we draw out of another Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, who ſpeaking of the place where the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was to be born ſaith,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Out of thee ſhall he come forth unto me, that is to be ruler in Iſrael, whoſe goings forth have been of old from everlaſting.</hi> Upon the occaſion of knowing the place where <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould be born, the<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Matt.</hi> 2.4, 5, 6.</note> Evangeliſt ſaith, how all the Chief Prieſts and Scribes quoted this very place to <hi>Herod;</hi> ſo that as certainly as he was to be born and was actually born there, as certainly his goings forth have been from of old from Everlaſting; this Prophecy was made ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hundreds of years before his Birth, yet at that very time he was ſaid to have gone forth from of old; what is to be underſtood by this, <hi>from of old,</hi> he
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:52204:93"/>there explains it thus, <hi>from everlaſting;</hi> the Hebrew word ſignifieth from the Days of Eternity, whence we may ſurely conclude that the Perſon ſpoken of in that place, namely, the Lord Jeſus hath been, and is from Eternity; here two goings or comings forth, be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, one paſſed, from of old, from everlaſting, the other to come, out of thee <hi>Bethlehem</hi> ſhall he come forth, <hi>&amp;c. Daniel</hi> calls him <hi>the antient of days,</hi> which is the very ſame Name in <hi>ver.</hi> 13. of the ſame Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter given the True God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whether taken Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially or Perſonally, whereby is denominated the true everlaſting God. Now out of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, on my way, I ſhall take notice of the place where he is called<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.15.</note> 
                  <hi>the firſt born of every creature,</hi> which (as the Adverſaries would have it) doth not include him amongſt the Creatures, rather it declares him not to be a Creature, if he was not made with the Creatures in time, then he was before all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were made that is from Eternity; for he that was before all Creatures is not created, ſo he was firſt born, becauſe born before any Creature was, far from being a Creature, he is the Creatour; for he created all things as anon we ſhall have occaſion to ſhew.</p>
               <p>Before I go on this, I muſt ſay how <hi>Socinus</hi>'s un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Deſign and great Miſtake is to interpret Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture meerly by Criticiſms upon the words, without any regard to the ſcope of the place, or the analogy of Faith, thus he ſearches into all the Senſes that they are poſſibly capable of, till he can find one, though never ſo forced to ſerve the Opinion he is prepoſſeſſed of, and before hand, though never ſo contrary to the plain and natural Senſe of the place. In the Preface to his Explication of the firſt of <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel, he owns, not wihtout Vanity, how his Interpretation is, new, <hi>quorum verus ſenſus,</hi> &amp;c. the true Senſe of which words, ſaith he, ſeems to have been hid from all the Expoſitors that ever were extant; how proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is this to applaud himſelf, as if he alone had known God's mind, as if the Spirit of God had not aſſiſted, but departed from all Good and Learned Men for
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:52204:94"/>1500 years after Chriſt, this is an over-affected ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of his, to turn all into Allegories, ſuch ſhifts to defend a Cauſe, do declare it to be bad, for 'tis only to preſerve it from ſinking,; and if once a Man hath leave to ſuppoſe what he pleaſes, then he may prove what he will; of this, now I ſhall give but one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, if by the word <hi>beginning</hi> which we read in <hi>John</hi> 1.1. we muſt as he doth, contrary to all parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of the Text, and the ſcope of the Evangeliſt, underſtand the beginning of the Goſpel; then accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this way of explaining, by the word <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> which we read in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1. we may underſtand not the beginning or Creation of the World, but of the beginning of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Diſpenſation, and ſo the Creation of Heaven and Earth to be the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion, and ſo ſeveral other things of the ſame Nature; this miſinterpretation of Holy Scripture is very injurious to't and dangerous, for after ſuch Notions and Fancies, no Error, though never ſo abſurd, can want one pretence or other to ſet up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſcope of Texts and Anology of Faith.</p>
               <p>But now we muſt go on,<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1.</note> 
                  <hi>In the beginning was the word,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>John,</hi> in that beginning the Word was with God, and in the ſame beginning the ſame Word was God, it being granted that Chriſt is ſignified by the name <hi>Word,</hi> that the Word is God; the Eternity of Chriſt may eaſily and naturally be underſtood by the Word Beginning, it appears how the Evangeliſt's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign is to aſſert the Divinity of Chriſt, wherewith he abruptly begins his Goſpel under that name he ſpeaks of him in the fourteen former Verſes of his firſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and then mentions it no more; he ſaith nothing of his Birth nor of any Circumſtance of its Time, Place or Perſon, but barely when, where, what he was, and what he did; this is plain enough, if ſome Men of perverſe Judgment had not thorough vain De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit and Cavils, gone about to darken and wreſt that Truth. By this beginning of time, is here, as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of Scripture, when ſpoken without limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, underſtood the beginning of the World, it having here, as I obſerved before, the ſame Signification, as
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:52204:94"/>in the firſt Verſe of the Book of <hi>Geneſis, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning God created,</hi> &amp;c. and that this is the meaning of this place, it appears out of the ſecond and third Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; in the ſecond is repeated what is ſaid in the firſt, <hi>the ſame was in the beginning with God;</hi> upon what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion was he then with God? Certainly, about the Work of Creation. for <hi>ver.</hi> 3. it is ſaid, <hi>All things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made;</hi> and what I ſay is the meaning of the word Beginning, I can make it appear out of Scip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that what they ſay, to reduce it only to the beginning of the Goſpel, is a falſe gloſs of theirs put upon the Words to pervert the Senſe;<note n="‖" place="margin">

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:52204:97"/>up Stones to caſt at him; for they had a right Notion of what he aimed at in his Diſcourſe, namely, to raiſe himſelf above all the Men in the World; amongſt them they lookt upon <hi>Abraham,</hi> whom they boaſted to call their Father, to be the Chief, and they believed none under God was greater than he; wherefore after he had ſaid, <hi>if a man keep my ſaying, he ſhall never ſee death;</hi> they grew mad againſt him, and preſently ſaid, <hi>Abraham</hi> is dead, ſo are the Prophets, and ſo asked him, <hi>Whom makeſt thou thy ſelf?</hi> they conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it could be no leſs than God, whereby it appears how all along they had a true apprehenſion of his meaning, though they were enraged at it, and could not hear it. It is a wonder to ſee how <hi>Socinians</hi> go about to corrupt and tear this Text all to pieces with their vain Sophiſtry; indeed the place is ſo cloſe upon them, that they will leave nothing unattempted to wreſt it; the Queſtion is about <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Age, the <hi>Jews</hi> would meaſure it by what appears of him, and as he is a Man, in which reſpect he denieth not what in their Senſe they ſay about his Age, but he will lead them farther, and make them look higher, and conſider him for what he was, as he had ſaid to them from the beginning, namely, the Son of God ſent by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſave the World.

               <p>Notwithſtanding this poſitive Truth, they give our bleſſed Saviour the lye, and ſay he had no real Glory before the World was, but only by a Decree and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, he was ordained to have a Glory: Good Lord! When will this People let the Son of God have his own? They go about to rob him wholly or in part of every thing he hath. Chriſt ſays not, the Glory which thou <hi>didſt</hi> decree or ordain for me, but which I <hi>had,</hi> was in poſſeſſion of, and enjoyed. To have a title to and be in poſſeſſion of a thing are two very different things; we defie them even to give any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance how to <hi>have,</hi> abſolutely taken, ſignifies to be appointed to have; if after this rate Men allow their Fancies ſuch a latitude as to forge new and unuſual Significations to the words of Chriſt, we can be ſure of nothing.

               <p>If their Expoſition be true, Chriſt might and would have ſaid, Glorifie me with the Glory which thou haſt decreed for me before the World was; then he had ſaid nothing but what every Believer may ſay, how that before the World was God fore-ordained them to the Glory which they ſhall enjoy at the laſt day; ſo might every one elſe ſay, before the World was I was fore-ordained to have Wife, Children, Lands, Offices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nay, according to their opinion, at the ſame time when <hi>Chriſt</hi> asked that Glory he had it, if to be appointed thereunto be to have it, and if he had it, why ſhould he ask for it?

Neither muſt this be reſtrained to Angels and Men, becauſe thoſe two kinds do not contain every Creature, and certainly if it be granted that every rational Creature was made by him, we may eaſily conclude of all the reſt, the more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis univerſally expreſſed of every Creature: The ſixteenth verſe doth explain and much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large upon the foregoing, and doth firſt univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and abſolutely affirm the whole work of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be the work of Chriſt, then makes a diſtribution, as things in Heaven and in Earth, of what nature, rank and degree ſoever, and this mention of things in Heaven and of things in Earth here expreſſed, ſheweth how the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles intention is to ſpeak of the firſt Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and not of the ſecond; this laſt or renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth not comprehend all things that are in Earth, but the firſt doth. Wherefore this laſt is not ſpoken of in this place, and tho elſewhere the word Creation be underſtood of the new and Spiritual Creation,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 3.9.</note> it doth not follow it muſt be ſo here; for there it is ſpoken of the revelation and predication of the Goſpel, which cannot be proved to be here the ſcope of
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:52204:110"/>the place where is to be ſeen not only the word to Create or Creation, but alſo the things created, are expreſſed as clearly as may be. Furthermore, it cannot be denyed, but by <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible</hi> things, as <hi>Thrones, Dominions,</hi> &amp;c. are meant Angels which were created with or before the World, that is very long before Chriſt his appearing in the Fleſh; but I find no where in Scripture, that ſince the firſt Creation they were renewed or created again: The good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels needed it not, for they were never defiled, the bad ones are not, for they continue as bad and wicked as ever; ſo 'tis very ſtrange that amongſt the Creatures renewed by Chriſt, they reckon the Devils themſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>lves, and who beſides them could ever have thought that in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the bare word Creature, ſignifies a new Creature; to Create, to Create a New? This is not at all the ſtile of the word of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we believe the Apoſtles ſpoke with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to be underſtood, and not to clog their Writings with Ambiguities, to cauſe doubts and difficulties: for on the contrary, here he makes things as intelligible as can be to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move ſcruples, as when he ſaith, all things that are in Heaven were by him Created, for fear there ſhould be ſome doubt about it, he explains it with the words viſible and inviſible, for in the Heavens are viſible things, as Sun, Moon, Stars, and alſo inviſible as Angels.</p>
               <p>Now there is no doubt but the Apoſtle in that commendation he gives of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> aimeth chiefly to ſhew his Dignity and Excellency, as being firſt born of every Creature; but the <hi>Socinians</hi> go about robbing him of that Prerogative, for 'tis ſpoken generally of every Creature without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but ſay they, not ſo, only of every new Creature; yet the Lord doth excel above e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Creature good or bad, high or low, and is Lord over all. If they ſay Chriſt is the firſt born of every Creature, only as it is a new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:52204:111"/>then it muſt be ſaid the Apoſtle is to blame for omiting the word <hi>new,</hi> though ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to underſtand his meaning, which is no better than as much as in them lies, to ridicule the Apoſtles word, how he is the firſt born of every Creature, in as much as every Creature is ſubject to his Dominion, for every thing is ſubjected to him thus far, as God hath ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected every thing unto him. But ſeeing they own Chriſt to be in time before every new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, what ſhall they ſay of ſome who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his birth of the Virgin, were new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſeeing 'tis he that made them all.

                  <hi>But to us there is but one God the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him: and one Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom are all things, and we by him.</hi> Here the Apoſtle upon the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of eating things offered unto Idols, ſaith, that an Idol is nothing in the world, though it be called God, as many things are called Gods and Lords, yet in reallity are not ſo, the names of God and Lord do properly belong only to the true God, whom he here oppoſeth to things falſely ſo called: As for us, we own but one God, and one Lord, whom he gives proper at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes unto; the one God is the Father, of

               <p>But it ſeems nothing in the world can ſtop the boundleſs impiety of men, who with their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions will, as far as they can, confine the Spirit of God within their own Sence: for upon the Text they ſay by <hi>all things</hi> we are to underſtand only thoſe which belong to the Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and to Chriſtianity as ſuch, which is a meer invention of <hi>Socinus</hi>'s Brain, and not of Chriſt or of his Apoſtles: However rather than to be mute, ſomething he will ſay; that the word <hi>all</hi> can have no relation to thoſe things that were before him, that is, before he was born of the Virgin, wherein he goes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his wrong principle, as if he was not at all before he was born of <hi>Mary,</hi> for though we own that according to the <hi>fleſh,</hi> Chriſt was not properly before he was born of her, yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Spirit</hi> he was, as accordingly hath been ſufficiently demonſtrated; and as to that Spiritual and Divine Being of his, all things were made by him, and he was Lord over all: But this Dominion of Chriſt he is endeavouring to reduce, not only within the time of our Saviour's being born of the Virgin, but alſo within that of his Reſurrection: But therein he makes a confuſion between Chriſt's <hi>purchaſed</hi> and his <hi>natural</hi> Dominions, which ought well to be diſtinguiſhed, the firſt was indeed after his death and reſurrection grounded upon our redemption, as formerly the ſpecial Right and Dominion of God over the people of Iſrael, was entailed upon his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving delivered them out of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> bondage, but tho he had not delivered them, yet ſtill he had been their Lord upon another and more anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent account; thus before Chriſt redeemed us

                  <hi>when ye knew not God, ye did ſervice unto them which by nature are no Gods,</hi> which they might have excuſed thus: Though we did ſo to thoſe that were not ſuch by nature, yet they were Gods by Office, Dignity and Power, but the Apoſtle, as I ſaid before, blameth them for doing ſo unto thoſe which by nature are not Gods: Wherefore religious worſhip is due only to ſuch as is God by nature, ſeeing then divine
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:52204:120"/>worſhip is due to Chriſt, as by and by I hope to prove, it implies that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is God by his nature; and certainly where the name of God and Son of God is abſolutely attributed as it is to Chriſt, it deſigns Nature more than Office or Dignity, ſo that the word Lord ſo often, and ſpecially in the New Teſtament attributed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, ſignifies in the ſtrict ſenſe, the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and independent Dominion of the Lord <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> over all, his being from the Father is by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, not in relation to his Eſſence, but to his perſon, not abſolutely, but relatively as he is Son, and if he be begotten, it neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows to be of the Eſſence or Nature of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which alſo ſhews the Eternity of that Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration: Theſe things I here repeat, becauſe when once that perſwaſion of Chriſt's being true Eſſential God is once ſetled in our minds, then without any ſcruple or difficulty, we may wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him, elſe men are at a ſtand, under fear of worſhiping the Creature inſtead of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, who is God bleſſed for ever.</p>
               <p>Before we prove that Chriſt is and ought to be worſhiped with a religious worſhip, for we ſpeak of no other, we intend to ſhew how the true eſſential God is alone to be worſhiped, and though to that effect ſeveral arguments might be drawn out of Scripture, we ſhall in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto examine only two, one is this,<note place="margin">Iſa. 42.8.</note> 
                  <hi>I am the Lord, that is my name, and my glory will I not give to another.</hi> This is a ſolemn declaration of the unchangeable God of Truth, who having given that ſame glory unto Chriſt muſt infallibly conclude Chriſt to be the ſame Lord <hi>Jehovah</hi> with him,<note place="margin">Chap. 48.11.</note> here the name and the glory of God do ſignifie the ſame, for ſometimes in Scripture, the Name of God ſignifies his Nature, when eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially taken, and the Attributes of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon when perſonally taken, never to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood barely of a name; when we love, fear and ſerve God, 'tis not the Letters, or a ſound in the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:52204:121"/>Air, but either the nature or ſome of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Trinity. But the truth of this here aſſerted, that the name and glory of God ſignifie the ſame,<note place="margin">Iſai. 42.8. <hi>compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with</hi> Exod. 33.18, 19.</note> is elſewhere confirmed poſitively and abſolutely, how his glory, God will not give to another, whoſoever he be. But as <hi>Socinus</hi> doth not uſe to take the words of God, as, and in the ſenſe he ſaith them, ſo here he would make God ſpeak otherwiſe than he doth, for he never wants his limitations, and therewith he limiteth the holy One the God of Iſrael: God, ſaith he, doth not ſay, I will not give my glory to another, that is, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent upon, and ſubordinate unto me, ſuch he makes the Lord Jeſus, but to graven Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: But do not Images of God, of Chriſt, of Angels, Apoſtles, depend upon and are ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to God as to the Matter, the form or making of them, the deſigns of men and all up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the will of God? Surely they do, for every Creature whatſoever is ſubordinate to, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon his Maker, and ſuppoſe God would chuſe one Creature, as may be an Angel, or any Man or Woman, and heap all the Treaſures of his Glory upon ſuch a one, which he yet declares he will not do, yet according to them he might do't, and not act againſt his ſolemn proteſtation that he will not do't, after this no Creature, as a Creature can differ from God, for they make God ſay he doth not intend to exclude any other wholly dependant upon, and ſubordinate to him, as is every Creature whatſoever, thus after this, the Effect ſhall be the ſame with the Cauſe, becauſe it depends upon it, this new ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the word <hi>another,</hi> deſerved well to have been confirmed by ſome example: in that other place already mentioned, which confirmeth this, there is no mention of Images or any thing elſe, barely, <hi>I will not give my glory unto another,</hi> which leaves no ground to Cavil about Images: Thus they would make the ſtrength of theſe
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:52204:121"/>words of God to vaniſh away, and be reſolved into this, God will not give his Glory to Images, but will give it to Angels and Men, even to Satan and Antichriſt the worſt of them.</p>
               <p>Then by the word to <hi>give,</hi> they underſtand only to <hi>permit,</hi> ſo if he giveth Money, Bread, Cloaths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he only permitteth, if to the word <hi>give,</hi> leave had been joyned, they might have pretended to ſomething, though there had been no ſenſe; thus with their altering the ſenſe of words, they would overthrow the uſe of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, and ſo coin one of their own, which none but themſelves ſhall underſtand, and by thoſe means teach all that went before, to ſpeak; then here according to their interpretation, contrary to what God declareth, he will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit or give graven Images ſomething of his glory, if they do not believe it themſelves, others who did worſhip thoſe Images will, for they thought God had communicated to them ſomething of his glory, or elſe would not have look't upon them as worthy to be Religiouſly worſhiped. But to come to the thing, ſince God in this place denyeth the permiſſion for any one to have his glory, much more doth he deny to give it himſelf to another, and if from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world he hath ſuffered the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil to uſurpe Divine Honour to himſelf, and ſeveral Nations religiouſly to worſhip Images, as 'tis known he hath, yet to neither he gave that glory of his, and out of this appeareth the true ſence of the Text, that he will, not <hi>permit,</hi> for he hath permitted, but, not <hi>give</hi> his glory, which he hath never given:<note place="margin">V. 6, 7,</note> But to come to the ſcope of the place, 'tis this, God ſaid it, when he ſpoke of Chriſt, as it appears by the two foregoing and following verſes, which may be peruſed, therein he is ſpoken of in ſuch a way, and to him are ſuch things attributed as belong not to one of a different nature, but to him that is
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:52204:122"/>one and the ſame with him; what is added about graven Images is to condemn Idolatry, and to take away all manner of excuſe from Idolaters, not only in thoſe times when all Nations were Idolaters and alſo that abominable ſin was gotten in the Land of <hi>Judah,</hi> but in relation to other Countries after the coming in the fleſh of the Son of God.</p>

               <p>Now to prove that the religious worſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the only true God, is appropriated to chriſt, we have ſeveral places out of Scripture, ſome do it in general, and others in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, whereof there are ſeveral branclies: Of the firſt Order is this, <hi>let all the Angels of God worſhip him,</hi> quoted out of the Pſalm: Upon theſe two unſhaken pillars,<note place="margin">Heb. 1.6.

               <p>To remove the weight of this argument which lie's ſo heavy upon them, and finding they cannot deny the Application to belong to Chriſt, the Adverſaries would not have the words to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the true God of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> but certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they ought to be related to him that is nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the next verſe but one before, namely the <hi>Lord of the whole earth,</hi> for indeed, in this <hi>Pſalm</hi> wherein is deſcribed the Majeſty of God's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, no other perſon is ſpoken of, but that God whoſe Kingdom it is.

                  <hi>tremble thou earth at the preſence of the Lord, at the preſence of the God of Jacob,</hi> whereby the interpretation of this now in hand is confirmed, and the God of <hi>Jacob</hi> is put inſtead of the Lord of the whole earth, in both which places, the repetition of the word, <hi>Preſence,</hi> is very Emphatical, which joyned with what I obſerved before, and with the words, the ſcope and the thing it ſelf do all together fully ſhew, here is but one perſon ſpoken of, which is confirmed more and more, becauſe in what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, the Prophet ſpeaks but of one as in the ſingular number,<note place="margin">verſ. 6.7, 8.</note> as thus <hi>the Heavens declare</hi> his <hi>righteouſneſs, and the people ſee</hi> his <hi>glory,</hi> and <hi>worship</hi> him <hi>all ye Gods:</hi> Alſo <hi>becauſe of</hi> thy <hi>judgments,</hi> whereby it appears 'tis ſpoken of one and not of two; but rather than to yield, they will ſooner give Chriſt whom otherwiſe they would rob of any thing he hath but his humane nature, which they cannot do, becauſe they muſt have an Hiſtorical Faith, or elſe may be they would, and reduce him to nothing. I ſay, they chuſe rather to give Chriſt that title and exclude God <hi>Jehovah</hi> from being the Lord of the whole earth, than to own Chriſt to be <hi>Jehovah,</hi> ſo what they do, is not out of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:52204:126"/>they only give him that which they think the leaſt, to rob him of what they account to be the chief, though indeed it be the ſame. Again, the words of verſe 7. do farther confirm this, <hi>Confounded be all they that ſerve graven images, that boaſt themſelves of Idols,</hi> therefore <hi>worſhip him all ye Gods.</hi> For who is oppoſed to graven Images and Idols, but he that is by nature the true God? And who is religiouſly to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped, but the true God <hi>Jehovah?</hi> And who but he who is the God of Gods, is to be adored by all Gods?<note place="margin">verſ. 9.</note> This is confirmed out of verſe 9. <hi>Thou Lord art high above all the earth: thou art exalted far above all Gods.</hi> The firſt part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a proper attribute of the true God, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the higheſt or moſt high God, for ſaith, <hi>David,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 33.18.</note> 
                  <hi>that men may know that thou whoſe name alone is Jehovah,</hi> art the moſt high <hi>over all the earth.</hi> Is not this the ſame as to be Lord over all the earth? So that both to be <hi>Jehovah</hi> and Lord over all the earth are attributed only to one, and if he be the only moſt high upon the earth, none but he, is Lord over all the earth. The latter part of the verſe doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford a reaſon and a very good one, why all Gods and Angels ought to worſhip him, becauſe <hi>he is for exalted above all Gods:</hi> No leſs than ſix times he is in this Pſalm called <hi>Jehovah,</hi> which cannot well be denied to be the ſame with <hi>God of Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One thing more I ſhall ſay as to this Pſalm, which with the foregoing and following, contain an exhortation to all Creatures, with and without life, to ſing and rejoyce before the Lord, and why? <hi>for he cometh, he cometh to judge the earth, he ſhall judge the world with righteouſneſs, and the people with his truth:</hi> which none that hath any ſence can deny to be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie of Chriſt's coming to judge the world, which he ſpeaks of himſelf: <hi>When the Son of man, ſhall come in his glory,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 25.31.</note> 
                  <hi>and all the holy Angels
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:52204:126"/>with him, then ſhall he ſit upon the throne of his glory.</hi> Then indeed, in that divine and glorious State, being attended and worſhiped by all mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Angels, he ſhall reign, fill with joy the hearts of his people, and perform the other things contained in this Pſalm. He that is to do all this, if we believe the Pſalmiſt, is the Lord <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, if we muſt give faith to the Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>Now we muſt draw nearer to the words of the Apoſtle, who is to be believed as well as the Prophet, preferably to <hi>Socinians,</hi> who being not able to deny it, own that Angels ought to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip Chriſt: One would think they at laſt would yield to the Truth, and give glory to God;<note place="margin">Phil. 2.7, 8, &amp;c.</note> but no ſuch thing, for they ſay, they may worſhip him as a man, and not upon the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any divinity in him, only upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his <hi>Humiliation and Obedience unto Death, even the Death of the Croſs,</hi> upon which account he was <hi>highly exalted.</hi> But pray, whence doth ariſe the value and merit of that Humiliation and Obedience, but from the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the perſon, which underwent it: If he had been a meer man, it had been no very great matter, no more than what many more could have done: A King's only Son, ſacrifices himſelf for the ſafety of a whole Kingdom, ſome among the ordinary people might have done the like, but that which raiſeth the merit of the thing, is, not his being a man, for any man elſe therein is equal with him, but 'tis the Royal Blood run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the Veins of the young Prince, which doth make the act ſo meritorious, and ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable; ſo if I may continue a lame compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſo defectuous, to repreſent what I have a mind, the Blood which our Saviour ſhed upon the Croſs doth not receive its unexpreſſible value for coming out of the Veins of a Man, but becauſe it is the <hi>blood of God, wherewith he hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Church.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 20.28.</note> Neither was the Obedience
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:52204:127"/>yielded by our Saviour, belonging only to his Humane Nature, which may be due and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from one in nature and quality inferiour to another, but it was alſo an undue and meerly voluntary obedience, which may be rendred by an Equal, and ſome times by a Superiour, as we read when <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſaid,<note place="margin">Joſn. 10.12, 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Sun ſtand thou ſtill up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Gibeon, and thou Moon in the valey of Ajalon, ſo the Sun ſtood;</hi> he was obeyed, but there is in it more than this, the Sun of himſelf could not ſtand nor alter or ſtop his Courſe; a Superiour power to do't was required; and indeed we find that in the beginning of the verſe, 'tis ſaid, <hi>then ſpook Joſhua unto the Lord in the day when,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Sun, ſtand thou ſtill;</hi> ſo, let it be ſpoken with that awful reverence and to an infinite Majeſty, in ſome kind we may ſee how in this caſe the Superiour was pleaſed to obey the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour; ſo we may ſay, a ſort of obedience may belong to Divine Nature, as when God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the World ſhould be created, and it was performed by his Son; of this nature is Chriſt's obedience, as ſpoken of by the Apoſtle concerning Chriſt,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.6, 7, 8.</note> 
                  <hi>who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God, he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelf.</hi> This was a voluntary obedience, for he was not humbled, <hi>but humbled himſelf,</hi> he was not made, <hi>but made himſelf of no reputation,</hi> thus the obedience is valued according to the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the perſon which obeyeth: To be in the form of God is to be God, for, <hi>forma dat eſſe rei,</hi> the form is the nature of the thing, and makes it to be what it is.</p>
               <p>But what this man granted before, he is now willing to take away, when he would have this worſhip not to be terminated in Chriſt, but from him to paſs unto God, ſo this is but a relative worſhip. Thus Papiſts ſay, they worſhip images; but they are miſtaken, for though God hath exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, it doth not follow that Adoration ſhould be only Tranſitory and not fixed; So God hath
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:52204:127"/>exalted the Kings of the Earth, but the Civil Wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhip or reſpect rendered unto the King is rendred unto a Man, but not in the capacity of a Man, but is terminated in him as he is a King, ſo when Chriſt Man is adored, he is not ſo under the notion of Man, but as he is God of the ſame nature with the Father, and that he is in the Father and the Father in him; the Father may well be worſhiped in him and he in the Father, but making them, as they do, to be of different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, I ſee no cauſe why they may not be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped aſunder one from another, which yet doth but rend and divide the object of our worſhip, with this new, as they call it, way of worſhip to adore God in a Man. But they muſt ſay what they underſtand by <hi>him,</hi> for both the Prophet and the Apoſtle make uſe of the word, Is it one or a different perſon named by them? if the ſame, then Chriſt is the one God; if not the ſame, then the Apoſtle hath not well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained the Prophet: If in the Pſalm, Chriſt be not ſpoken of, but only the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> of a nature altogether different; then in the Epiſtle the words are made uſe of to no purpoſe, for therein the deſign is to prove how Chriſt muſt be worſhiped by all Angels: Now he doth not anſwer his purpoſe, when to prove one who is not the God <hi>Iſrael</hi> ought to be adored, he brings a Text which commands the Angels to adore him only who is the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> a great diſparagement indeed, not only to the Author of the Epiſtle, but to the Spirit of God which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected him; he ſaith, in that worſhip exhibited unto Chriſt, the Lord Jeſus repreſents the perſon of God the Father, how? as an Actor upon the Stage doth repreſent a King? After this rate Chriſt with all the worſhip given him, would be (without blaſphemy let it be ſpoken) but a Stage God. If to reign doth ſignifie the Kingdom of Chriſt, why ſhall not alſo the name <hi>Jehovah</hi> who reigneth, belong to his perſon?
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:52204:128"/>If he hath the thing, why ſhould he not have the name alſo, Chriſts Kingdom is therein deſcribed, <hi>Jehovah</hi> is the King, why ſhould not Chriſt be <hi>Jehovah?</hi> which if he be, it muſt be properly, for Chriſt nor no one elſe was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver figuratively called <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt under the name of God is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed; then if Chriſt be not God <hi>Jehovah,</hi> then 'tis <hi>Jehovah</hi> that indeed doth repreſent Chriſt, ſo he muſt be the Type of Chriſt, thus they unavoidably run into abſurdities; but in very deed Chriſt doth not act the part of the Father, but his own: He doth act the part of three perſons upon the account of his three ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral offices, of a Prophet, of a Prieſt, and of a King, he therein exerciſeth his own office and not that of the Father, he doth what belongeth to him and not to others,<note place="margin">Joh. 17.10.</note> and <hi>as all things the Father hath, are his;</hi> ſo the Kingdom, Throne, Scepter, Power, Majeſty, Miniſtry and Subjects are all his; if he received the Kingdom from the Father, he received it as only begotten Son and Heir of all things, not as of anothers but as his own, wherefore he doth not reign as a Servant or a Miniſter of the Farther, ſo then, when he reigneth, he doth not repreſent the Father's perſon but his own, not as his Vicar or Lieutenant, but as God equal with him. The firſt part of the verſe,<note place="margin">Matth. 1.20. Luke 2.9, 13. Matth. 28.2, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>and again when he bringeth in the first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten into the world,</hi> ſheweth how at his firſt coming into the world he was worſhiped and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Angels for his Conception, Birth and Reſurrection were publiſhed by Angels, and then it demonſtrates there are two perſons, one that bringeth, the other that is brought in; the one is the Father, the other the Son; the firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the laſt to be adored, for he ſaith not worſhip me, but <hi>him:</hi> There is an <hi>Emphaſis</hi> in the word firſt begotten, ſimply ſpoken, to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of <hi>every Creature;</hi>

               <p>But as we proved the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> ought to be worſhiped by Angels, ſo we now muſt ſhew he ought to be by men; and the place is this, <hi>That all men ſhould honour the Son even as they honour the Father, he that honoureth not the Son,</hi>

                  <hi>honoureth not the Father that ſent him.</hi> To underſtand the place well, we muſt go up higher, and take notice how from verſe 17. to 23. our Saviour ſpeaks of his equality with the Father (as well underſtood by the <hi>Jews</hi>) in his Nature and Power, with making a parallel between the Father and himſelf, the more becauſe he uſeth not a pronoun relative, but poſſeſſive, not <hi>the</hi> Father, but <hi>my</hi> Father; <hi>my father worketh hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to and I work,</hi> not the Father that is a Common Father as God is to all, but my Father, in a moſt ſpecial and true manner, who hath communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his nature unto me: Now that equality with the Father, he on another account doth inſiſt upon, but he doth not in the leaſt go about to ſhew that he made not himſelf equal with the Father, which certainly he would have done, if it had not been true and only a miſtake in them, and thereby he could have calmed their rage: on the contrary he ſpeaks to confirm this equality of his with the Father, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his divine power, manifeſted in his works, one whereof upon occaſion was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring the impotent Man that had the infirmity for 38 years, to the uſe of his Limbs and perfect Health, which none could deny to have been done by a divine Power: Now none but God can have a power equal with God, for God's power is infinite, but that of any Creature is finite, and ſo there is no equality between finite and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, this equality of Power and Working is
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:52204:129"/>here clearly demonſtrated, <hi>For what things ſoever the Father doth, theſe alſo doth the Son likewiſe:</hi> That is, the Father doth nothing but what the Son doth alſo; and this he inſtanceth in the caſe of raiſing the dead, which none but a Divine and Infinite Power can Effect, <hi>For as the Father raiſeth up the dead and quickeneth them, even ſo the Son quickeneth whom he will:</hi> That is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception he can do what he will, now 'tis an Attribute of God,<note place="margin">Pſal. 115.3. and 135.6.</note> to <hi>do what it pleaſeth him in Heaven, in Earth, and in the Sea.</hi> Becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> believed not our Saviour to be more than a Man, he in the exerciſe of his Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Office, went often about, both in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes and Works, to inſinuate into them that he was God, and in this place he preſſes it much upon them, both by what I already ſaid, and by what he addeth in <hi>v.</hi> 22. <hi>The Father judgeth no man: but hath committed all judgment unto the Son,</hi> and the end which in ſo doing, the Father, and he in declaring it, propoſed unto themſelves, is this, that all men ſhould honour the Son even as they honour the Father, as the Son in Nature and Power is equal with the Father, ſo he ought equally to be honoured or worſhiped as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, and this Divine Honour is ſo equally due to both, that <hi>he which honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father,</hi> for the Father cannot and will not be honoured, that is, worſhiped without him, for honour rendred unto God is the ſame as religious worſhip: The Son muſt be honoured in the ſame nature, manner and degree as the Father is.</p>
               <p>One would think this to be plain and clear enough beyond all exception, yet they Cavil thus, the word <hi>as</hi> doth not import an equal honour, but only a likeneſs, and this they go about to confirm out of two places, the firſt, is <hi>every man that hath this hope in him,</hi>

               <p>In the two objected places, and in our Text, there are indeed duties expreſſed but different, in that of <hi>John</hi> here, 'tis in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to God, in the others as to our ſelves, the firſt doth regard the worſhip of God, the other holineſs in our ſelves; in our Text a parity and equality is implied, which is not in the others, the difference of the ſenſe is grounded upon two things; <hi>Firſt,</hi> of the <hi>ſcope</hi> of the ſpirit of God in thoſe places; <hi>Secondly,</hi> of the <hi>Analogy</hi> of Faith: To know the ſcope of the Text we now are upon, one muſt go back to <hi>verſe</hi> 18. the cauſe of the <hi>Jews</hi> hatred and ſeeking to kill our Saviour, was becauſe he made himſelf equal with God, which he to ſhew they had no cauſe to take exceptions againſt it, as we ſaid before, proves it by an equality of power, in raiſing the Dead, and of judging the world. As to this laſt he goeth further, for he ſaith the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto him; but what doth all this aim at? The ſcope is, to the end that all men ſhould honour the Son, even as they honour the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, God the Father will have all men to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour his Son, as they honour him, without any difference, becauſe his Son is equal with him, and this affirmative is ſtrengthned with a negative, for <hi>he that honoureth not the Son,</hi>

                  <hi>honoureth not</hi>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:52204:130"/>the <hi>Father,</hi> ſo that to honour one is to honour the other, and one cannot well honour the Father, except he equally honoureth the Son: this is the true ſenſe of the place. We ought to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Son in the ſame ſenſe and manner as we muſt believe in him, that is, as much and as well as we are to believe in the Father, that is, to put our whole truſt and confidence in the Son as in the Father, ſo all the honour both in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity and quality, which we render to the Father muſt be given to the Son.</p>
               <p>Now as to the <hi>Analogy</hi> of Faith, that is, that this ſenſe doth not contradict, but well agree with other Scriptures, it appears out of this: the Great Commandment and Duty of Man, is, as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God,</hi>

Heb. 12.14.</note> is to exhort Chriſtians to ſtudy and labour after Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Holineſs, <hi>which they are called unto:</hi> All that are adopted Children ought to <hi>walk in holineſs,</hi> becauſe <hi>holineſs becomes the houſe of God,</hi> and as <hi>without faith 'tis impoſsible to pleaſe God,</hi> ſo <hi>without holineſs no man shall ſee the Lord.</hi> This great and neceſſary duty, I ſay, the two Apoſtles in theſe Texts, do exhort men to ſtrive and labour after, not as to attain to ſuch a perfection of holineſs as is in God, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for any Man; for all that we can deſire, is <hi>that we may be partakers of his holineſs,</hi>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Such an interpretation would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the <hi>Analogy</hi> of Faith, as contrary to the truth ſet down in other places of Scripture: For though holineſs be a communicable Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of God, yet there cannot be ſo much as thought to be an equality between Purity and Holineſs in God, and thoſe ſmall portions he is graciouſly pleaſed to impart unto us. Holineſs is Eſſentially, and Originatively in God; nay, Holineſs is God infinitely and moſt ſimply holy, and we are naturally unclean, tranſgreſſors from the Womb, conceived in Sin, brought forth in Iniquity, wallowing in our own Blood, till God be pleaſed to waſh and cleanſe us, to derive from himſelf, and by his holy ſpirit to work
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:52204:131"/>ſome ſmall degree of holineſs in us; God is moſt holy,<note place="margin">Luke 6.36.</note> thrice Holy: In the ſame ſenſe, we are commanded to be merciful, <hi>as</hi> our Father alſo is merciful, that is, as far as God will be pleaſed to enable us: we ought to follow and imitate that Pattern, but not pretend or hope to arrive to the perfection of it, which, in both Mercy and Holineſs, were no leſs than Blaſphemy; wherefore ſuch interpretations God's word doth abhor; and in that place St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith not, Every man that hath this hope <hi>hath purified</hi> in the Praetertenſe, but in the Preſent <hi>purifieth</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to ſhew how he doth but aim at it and by degrees: And St. <hi>Peter</hi> in the 16. <hi>v.</hi> explains the ſenſe of the foregoing verſe, <hi>becauſe it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>be ye holy, for I am holy,</hi> he ſhews no equality or parity of holineſs. The word <hi>as,</hi> which he uſed before, he now renders by <hi>for,</hi> as a motive and a cauſe, why we ought to be holy? Becauſe God is holy.</p>
               <p>To what I ſaid before, I ſhall now add at laſt how the word <hi>as</hi> doth in other places denote an equality, <hi>as the Father knoweth me, even ſo know I the Father,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 10.15.</note> which in the Greek word is taken for to love; he equally knows and loves the Father, with an Eternal and perfect Love, as the Father knoweth and loveth him: The words <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal: Now to underſtand the foregoing places of an equality,<note place="margin">Chap 5. 26.</note> is not contrary to other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, nor to the Analogy of Faith, but doth tend to the glory of both Father and Son; for the rule is moſt true in the Text now in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, he that honoureth not the Son, honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the Father that ſent him; but he that honoureth the Son, honoureth the Father alſo, which is a natural inference out of the place. But that people who pretend to honour the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:52204:131"/>have taken a quite contrary way to do't, which is diſhonouring the Son,<note place="margin">Joh. 8.49.</note> as he ſaid to the Jews, <hi>I honour my Father, and ye diſhonour me,</hi> with robbing him, if they could, of his divine Nature and Attributes, when 'tis moſt true that <hi>he that honoureth not the Son,</hi>

               <p>Having thus proved in general that divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip belongs to Chriſt, we muſt now come to the places which demonſtrate it in the particulars: As <hi>firſt,</hi> we are <hi>baptized</hi> in his name: Baptiſm is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ordinance, whereby being admitted to be members of Chriſt's myſtical body, we take an Oath of Allegiance to him, whereby we own him to be our God and Redeemer, this is the ſeal of the Covenant. Now no Covenant is in force till it be paſſed the Seal; this Seal in Baptiſm is not only inſtituted by Chriſt, but alſo adminiſtred in his name and authority, whereby it doth appear that this is his Right, which Right of his,<note place="margin">Matth. 28.19.</note> he would make uſe of when he commanded all Nations to be baptized in his name. None but God can inſtitute Sacraments, for none but he can beſtow the grace therein repreſented; none but the Lord of the Houſe hath right to make Laws in his Houſe; now the Church is God's Houſe, and ſeeing the preaching of the Word, and adminiſtration of both Sacraments therein, is done by Chriſt's authority and in his name, he is thereby not only owned, but alſo worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as God and Lord of it, wherefore the Church is called <hi>Chriſt's own houſe.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 3.6.</note> I find indeed there was a ſubordination between God and <hi>Moſes,</hi> this being but a Servant, but the ſame ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation between God and <hi>Moſes</hi> was between the Son of God and <hi>Moſes,</hi> as is now of all Miniſters of the Goſpel under Chriſt,<note place="margin">Mal. 3.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:52204:132"/>the Temple is the place for Adoration, and the Lord of the Temple is to be adored, and the worſhip proper for God is due to him. We are equally baptized in the name of the Father Son and Holy Ghoſt; for in the words of the Inſtitution and form of Adminiſtration, there is no other difference but of order, the names are jointly uſed, without any ſign of diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as to Nature or Power, all three are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in called upon, there being in them an equal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and Authority.

               <p>But that men were in the practice, as by the inſtitution they ought to be, baptized in the name of Chriſt, it appears out of what <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid to the new Converts, <hi>be baptized every one of you in the name of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 2.38.</note> where we ſee he takes notice only of Jeſus Chriſt, not to exclude either Father or Holy Ghoſt, but ſtrongly to inſinuate into their minds and hearts, how Chriſt was their God, Lord and Saviour, which to Preach and perſwade was his great end, and this he would have them to make open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of in their being baptized in his name, whereby he ſhews the neceſſity and comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiveneſs of Chriſt's name uſed in the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that holy Sacrament, and the end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is <hi>for the remiſſion of ſins,</hi> that is to obtain pardon of ſins, yea, and <hi>to receive the gift of the holy ghoſt.</hi> So when the <hi>Centurion</hi>'s family was baptized,<note place="margin">Acts 10.43. chap. 19.5. 1 Cor. 1.13.</note> 'tis ſaid only they were baptized in the name of the Lord. The name ſignifies the authority of the Lord, which in this caſe <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo much concerned for upon the occaſion of the contentions that were among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> which makes him ſo ſharply expoſtulate with them, <hi>were ye baptized in the name of Paul?</hi> This point muſt needs be one of the higheſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance in our Religion, ſeeing, he is ſo earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:52204:132"/>concerned as to ſay, <hi>I thank God I baptized none of you,</hi> &amp;c. and he gives his reaſon for't, <hi>leſt any ſhould ſay, I baptized in my name.</hi> Whence we may conclude that to baptize in the name of Chriſt is one of the moſt fundamental points of Chriſtian Religion, and I think it a rule and practice highly commendable in thoſe Churches where in baptiſm, the word name is prefixed before every one of the three perſons thus, <hi>I baptize thee in the name of the Father, in the name of the Son, and in the name of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> diſtinctly pronounced, to prevent the abuſe of ſome wretched <hi>Socinians,</hi> which by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the affinity which in ſome Languages, the words <hi>name</hi> and <hi>none</hi> or <hi>not,</hi> have, do confound them, and to baptize in the name of the Father, <hi>not</hi> of the Son, <hi>not</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt: Then it is Eſſential in baptiſm to have it adminiſtred in the name of the Son, as well as of the Father, wherefore <hi>John</hi> who by reaſon of this office is called <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> did it, not in his own name, on the contrary declared himſelf but a Miniſter when he pointed at Chriſt and ſaid, <hi>I indeed baptize you with water, but he that comes after me and is mighter than I, he shall baptize you with the holy ghoſt and with fire;</hi> as if he had ſaid, his Servant can adminiſter only the outward ſign, but the thing and grace ſignified, he alone can give. Hence I conclude that Chriſt in our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing baptized in his name, is by us therein wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped as our God equally with the Father: Here they make a difficulty, becauſe 'tis ſaid the Fathers were baptized unto <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Cloud, but that ſignifieth not to be baptized in the name and authority of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but to be ſettled in the faith to be given to Gods word ſpoken by the Miniſtery of <hi>Moſes,</hi>

               <p>Now out of Scripture we prove how Chriſt was called upon and prayed to,<note place="margin">Acts 7.59.</note> 
                  <hi>they ſtoned</hi> Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen, <hi>calling upon God and ſaying, Lord Jeſus receive my ſpirit.</hi> He calls him Lord and God, he was not the only one that called upon him, though the circumſtance of his being a dying, when no help in men, makes it very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: many others called upon him, for this deſcription is made of Chriſtians and Believers,<note place="margin">Acts 9.13.14.</note> that they called upon him: Thus <hi>Ananias, Lord he hath authority,</hi> Saul, <hi>from the chief Prieſts to bind all that call on thy name,</hi> all that made a profeſſion of the Goſpel. Moſt of his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles <hi>Paul</hi> begins with wiſhing <hi>Grace, Peace and Mercy,</hi> not only from God the Father, but alſo <hi>from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and often the ſame Epiſtles he concludeth thus: <hi>the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt be with you all,</hi> which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but to call upon him for Favour and Mercy; for whoſoever wiſheth any one Grace and Peace from Chriſt, thereby prayeth to Chriſt to beſtow grace and favour upon ſuch an one;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.8, 9.</note> and in plain and clear terms he called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and prayed to Chriſt; <hi>For this thing I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought the Lord thrice, and he ſaid unto me, my grace is ſufficient for thee, for my ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſs:</hi> This is to ſpeak as God doth, not only <hi>Paul</hi> called upon the Lord Jeſus, but ſaith there were ſome in every place that call upon the name of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> our Lord,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.2.</note> to whom all as to the Church in <hi>Corinth</hi> he directed his Epiſtle: And no wonder if they
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:52204:136"/>who are deſirous of their ſpiritual wellfare, do call upon the name of the Lord, for he is ſo rich unto all that call upon him, that he hath entailed Salvation upon the performance of that duty, which I ſpeak not as of my ſelf,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.12, 13. Acts 2.21.</note> but two Apoſtles will be bound for it; <hi>For whoſoever ſhall call upon the name of the Lord, ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; ſaith one.</hi> And <hi>it ſhall come to paſs that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall call upon the name of the Lord ſhall be ſaved,</hi> ſaith another:<note place="margin">Joel. 2.32.</note> and both have a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet for ſecurity of what they ſay. Now Prayer is a religious duty to be directed to none but to God; all this is example: But the reaſon is this, he without whom we cannot call upon the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, muſt alſo be called upon, but the Father we cannot call upon without Chriſt,<note place="margin">John 14.6.</note> becauſe <hi>none can come unto the Father but by him, and he is the way:</hi> But here is a command beſides;<note place="margin">Chap. 16.24.</note> 
                  <hi>hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name, ask and ye shall receive.</hi> There is a place in Scripture where three parts of worſhip due to Chriſt,<note place="margin">Acts 22.16.</note> are contained: <hi>and now,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ananias</hi> unto <hi>Paul, why tarriest thou, be baptized, and wash away thy ſins, calling on the name of the Lord,</hi> in all three is the name of the Lord, the firſt and laſt are plain, but Faith is mean't by waſhing away ſins, which are waſhed when forgiven, now our ſins are forgiven when we are juſtified through faith in Chriſt,<note place="margin">Chap. 26.18.</note> or when <hi>we are ſanctified by faith that is in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againſt this 'tis argued out of the Preface of the Lord's Prayer, <hi>our Father,</hi> that there 'tis ſpoken of the Father excluſively to the Son: But in that place as in ſeveral others, the word Father is not taken Perſonally, but Eſſentially, excluſively not to Son and Holy Ghoſt, but to <hi>Idols</hi> and Creatures; the word Father is here taken for God, as 'tis when ſaid, <hi>one God and Father of all,</hi> and <hi>Abba-Father:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.6. Rom. 8.15.</note> Alſo <hi>the Father of Spirits:</hi> The words <hi>our Father</hi> are often taken for <hi>our God and Lord:</hi> In thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:52204:137"/>the word Father is ſaid <hi>relatively</hi> not to the Son,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.9. Matth. 10.21, 29. Luke 30.32. John 14.13. Chap. 3.13</note> but to men whoſe Father God is. The things in the Lord's Prayer asked and prayed for, are asked of the Son as well as of the Father, as the coming of his Kingdom, the forgiveneſs of our Sins, whence ſaith our Lord, <hi>Whatſoever ye shall ask in my name, that I will do:</hi> And the words, <hi>which are in Heaven,</hi> do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Son as to the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt too, as appeareth out of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.7, 8. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.16. Nay as we ſaid before, the Son is called the everlaſting Father: And if we conſider the Etymology of the word, which in the Original ſignifieth, <hi>to preſerve all things,</hi> we ſhall find he is a Father indeed, by whom all things are upheld and preſerved, which the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit within us beareth witneſs unto, when our heart laying under the ſenſe of ſome trouble or mercy, doth on a ſudden by means of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jaculatory Prayer, either in thoughts, words or both, poure it ſelf before him, begging for help or giving thanks, breaking out upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into theſe or the like expreſſions, <hi>Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> have pity on me, or, <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> make me thankful.</p>
               <p>Thus I, through the grace of God, have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe ſeveral heads brought in proofs for our bleſſed Lord and Saviour's divinity: of many more which Scripture affords, I ſhall take notice but of few, wherein he is properly and truly called God, which to aſſert is the main drift of the word, as it is the foundation of the whole Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; for it was abſolutely neceſſary he ſhould be God by nature, or elſe any man might have preached, taught, prayed, given good example, and made interceſſion as well as Chriſt, and if he came into the world and dyed only to teach us good doctrine and give us good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he had done for us no more than the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Martyrs, who taught good doctrine and gave good example, ſo might as well be
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:52204:137"/>called our Mediators and Saviours. If this had, as they ſay, been the whole work of the Mediator, our redemption had been no hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be performed: But I ſay that his threefold office of Mediatorſhip, Prophecy, Kingſhip, and Prieſthood, demonſtrate him to be true Eſſential God, for none of the three could perfectly have been performed but by a God himſelf: As to the Prophetical, to enlighten the underſtanding, and effectually to turn the heart; as to the Regal, to defend Believers againſt the Power of Satan; and as to the Prieſtly to obtain forgiveneſs of Sins, favour of God and glory, none of theſe could be obtained, but by him who is infinite as in Power ſo in Nature, there is an infinite diſtance between God who is infinite and every finite Creature, no proportion between Infinite and Finite. Scripture owneth nothing but God to be higher than Angels; now Chriſt is higher and above all Angels. Beſides, that the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of ſatisfaction to be given to Divine Juſtice doth argue a neceſſity for Chriſt to be God, for the ſatisfaction could not have been adequate, as it ought to be, except he was God, and this divinity in him, doth prove the plurality of perſons in the God-head, which is the whole of the difficulty alledged againſt the moſt holy Trinity. Certainly the great deſign of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and others, was to preach Chriſt to be truely and really God, Son of God whereby their Miniſtry was exalted, this was the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation they were to build upon:<note place="margin">Acts 8.37.</note> The Eunuch muſt make this Confeſſion, <hi>I believe that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God,</hi> before he could be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, ſo did every one elſe being converted to the Faith, this in our Religion is the firſt thing to be known and preached, thus <hi>Paul,</hi> after his Converſion,<note place="margin">Chap. 9.20.</note> the firſt thing he did, was to preach that <hi>Chriſt is the Son of God,</hi> for that was the great queſtion; the <hi>Jews</hi> denyed him not to be Man, Son of Man, but he went about to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:52204:138"/>them how alſo he was God, Son of God, and he was by Nature God, as certainly as by nature he was Man: Wherefore he would raiſe the thoughts of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> from the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt's humanity to that of his Deity, when he ſaith,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.16.</note> 
                  <hi>though we have known Chriſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fleſh, yet now henceforth know we him no more</hi> after the fleſh, but according to the ſpirit, not in the humane but in the divine nature: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which he is called by the glorious names of <hi>the holy one,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 3.14, 15. 1 Cor. 2.8.</note> 
                  <hi>and the juſt, the prince of life,</hi> and <hi>the Lord of glory,</hi> our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, who when he was in the world had ſo often declared himſelf to be the Son of God in a proper ſenſe, after his Aſcenſion, when he had a full poſſeſſion of that glory, as it were to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm from Heaven what he had declared upon Earth, in the Revelation he made to that diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his, who doth ſo eminently bear witneſs of his divinity,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 4.14, 15.</note> when he ſaith, <hi>we have ſeen and do teſtifie, that the Father ſent the Son to be the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the world; and whoſoever ſhall confeſs that Jeſus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God,</hi> and not otherwiſe; I ſay, on that occaſion, the Lord Jeſus from Heaven proclaims himſelf to be Son of God in the letter to the Angel of the Church in <hi>Thiatira,</hi> with this glorious deſcription,<note place="margin">Rev. 2.18. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with chap. 1.14, 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Theſe things ſaith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet like unto fine braſs.</hi> Tho his enemies would not hear him upon earth, during the time of his humiliation, when through his Paſſive Obedience he was about performing the firſt part of his Prieſtly Office, to ſatisfie divine Juſtice, and make expiation for our ſins, I think now they ſhould when he ſpeaks from Heaven whence he exerciſes his Royal Office: I know well enough how what I ſay about his ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Divine Juſtice through his death, doth not affect his enemies, who deny he hath given ſatisfaction for us, but what can his interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:52204:138"/>on in Heaven which is the ſecond part of his Prieſthood be grounded upon, but his own merits, through his Sufferings and Death, he thereby hath payed our Debts, and by vertue of that payment, he asks we ſhould be releaſed: but that point I intend not to meddle with in this place.</p>
               <p>In the New Teſtament, the name <hi>Saviour</hi> is as proper to him as that of Chriſt, as indeed that of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the ſame with Saviour, was given him by the Angel; and by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the name Saviour is often joyned with that of God,<note place="margin">Tit. 1.3.</note> 
                  <hi>according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of God our Saviour,</hi> both names be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to one and the ſame perſon, as truly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and actually God, as he is Saviour, and in another place all theſe names God, Saviour, and Lord are given to Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>by the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.1.</note> As he is Jeſus Chriſt, ſo as certainly he is God, Lord and Saviour, not only his Offices but alſo his divine Nature is therein contained, and in the ſame Chapter he calls him the <hi>Bleſſed God,</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">ver. </seg>11</label> as in another place, <hi>God Bleſſed for ever.</hi> That Chriſt is thereby meant it appears by his ſaying, the glorious Goſpel of the Bleſſed God. Now 'tis in ſeveral places called the Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> wherefore in almoſt every Epiſtle of his, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth himſelf an Apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Mark 1.1. Rom. 1.16 1 Cor. 9.12 18. Gal. 1.7. Rom. 8.9.</note> ſent by him to preach the Goſpel. So elſewhere, he ſaith, <hi>if ſo be that the ſpirit of God dwell in you, now if any man have not the ſpirit of Chriſt, he is none of his.</hi> That which in the beginning of the verſe, <hi>Paul</hi> calls the ſpirit of God in the latter end he calls the Spirit of Chriſt, whereby he makes God and Chriſt to be but one and the ſame perſon.</p>
               <p>Under another Head our Bleſſed Saviour doth in many places afford us an argument for his divinity, conſiſting in a certain divine manner of ſpeaking with Authority, not as ſubordinate or delegate, but original in him as the Head
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:52204:139"/>and Spring, not as by Favour and Courteſie derived upon him, but out of his own natural Right, which is above what any Man ever did or could pretend to; as when in his Sermon up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Mount, he reformeth the abuſes crept in againſt the Law, wherein he aſſerteth his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative Power at ſeveral times,<note place="margin">Matth. 5.20, 22, 28, 32, 34, 39, 44. Chap. 7.29.</note> 
                  <hi>but I ſay unto you:</hi> And the people that heard him could take notice how <hi>he taught them as one having authority; and not as the Scribes.</hi> And he ſaid unto his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples when he ſent them, <hi>recive ye the holy ghoſt,</hi> whoſeſoever ſins ye remit, they are remitted, and whoſeſoever ſins ye retain they are retained, and to <hi>Peter, Feed my Sheep: go and teach all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> All theſe are words of Command. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let us obſerve how no Man's Will is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the rule of another's: one Man's Will is free and independent from that of another; no Man is bound abſolutely to follow the will of another, becauſe every Man's Will is fallible, and ſo may led us into errour, but the will of God alone is infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, and ſo alone to be followed; wherefore in our Prayer ſimply we ſay, <hi>thy will be done,</hi> and when Man's Will is to be obeyed, 'tis <hi>relatively</hi> and only in conformity to that of God. But Chriſt's Will is the Law, without Diſpute or Exception, thus when he calls thoſe that are hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy laden,<note place="margin">Matth. 11.27, 28.</note> he poſitively ſaith, <hi>I will give you reſt,</hi> having in the foregoing verſe affirmed how none knoweth the Father, but he to whom the Son will reveal him: Thus when he cured the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, he ſaid, <hi>I will, be thou clean;</hi> ſo he ſaith, <hi>The Son quickeneth whom he will,</hi> and <hi>him that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth on me I will raiſe up at the last day.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 6.40, 44.</note> Herein is his own Power ſet forth. So 'tis when ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Woman, that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he will give ſhall be in him that receives it a Well <hi>of water ſpringing up into everlaſting life:</hi> and in that other place, <hi>If any man thirſt let him come unto me and drink.</hi> He doth not ſay, I will pray the Father, that he may have everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:52204:139"/>life, or that out of his belly may flow rivers of living water, but let him come to me, and without going for this farther to any, he ſhall certainly drink and be ſatisfied, for that I will do for him; this is to ſpeak like Lord, Maſter and God. But it may be ſaid, Men he may ſpeak to after that rate, being ſo graciouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted above them all: well but I will go higher and ſay ſomething more than hath been hitherto: when the Lord Jeſus ſpeaks to the Father,<note place="margin">Joh. 17.24.</note> he ſometimes ſaith, <hi>I will,</hi> as in the Prayer which before his leaving the World in the capacity of Mediator, he puts up to him for the Elect, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I will that they alſo whom thou haſt given me, be with me where I am to behold my glory,</hi> thus according to his own will he diſpoſeth of Glory: Did any Man meerly ſuch, ever ſpeak to God in that way? <hi>Elijah</hi> and <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> were the two moſt fervent Men in ſpirit that we read of in Scripture, but can we ever find any thing like this, that ever they did or ſaid? No, none but God the Son can be ſo familiar with God the Father, and we muſt believe that he well knew both God the Father and himſelf when he ſpake thus, &amp; except he had been ſure he might, he would not have done it; but it had been as a moſt unſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable Preſumption, nay Blaſphemy in any Man to have ſaid ſo, we muſt conclude he was more than a Man, and that he thus ſpoke upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther account, even upon the ſame he had ſaid before, <hi>I and the Father are one,</hi> and <hi>had made himſelf equal with God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We read how our Saviour <hi>took on him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 2.16.</note> 
                  <hi>not the nature of Angels, but he took on him the ſeed of Abraham,</hi> the reduplication, <hi>took not,</hi> and <hi>took</hi> denotes the voluntary Act of a perſon who made a choice, which he had not been in a capacity to do, except he had <hi>praeexiſted</hi> before he took the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſo that before he was made of the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> he muſt need have had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Being, and before he was made he muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:52204:140"/>have been God, he could not have been an Angel, becauſe he took not upon him the nature of Angels. Again, our Saviour ſaith, <hi>I aſcend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God;</hi> why not to our Father, as he ſaid, when he taught them to pray for themſelves? For if they had been brethren upon the ſame bottom of Grace, though in different degrees, he would have ſpoken of him as of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Father, but ſpeaking diſjunctively and in different numbers, ſeeing he ſaid, and did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without good cauſe, there muſt be a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular reaſon for it, which is naturally and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily inſinuated to be this, That God was their Father and His, not upon a common, one and the ſame, but upon a much different account their Father by Grace, and his by Nature. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, Chriſt ſo often ſpeaketh of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent by the Father, as <hi>I ſeek not my own will,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 5.3 &amp; 6 38. Chap. 7.16. Mark 9.37.</note> 
                  <hi>but the will of him that ſent me, I came down from Heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that ſent me; my Doctrine in not mine, but his that ſent me; he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth me, receiveth not me, but him that ſent me; he that believeth in me, believeth not in me, but in him that ſent me;</hi> all this to conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to the Hypotheſes of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the opinion they had of him; namely, that he was a meer man, but ſeeing he was not come of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but was ſent by the Father, he thereby would intimate unto them how they ought to look upon him to be more than a man, ſince he had a being before he was born amongſt them, and was ſent by the Father, whereby they all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood well enough how he meant, and ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led himſelf the Son of God; This Argument did his Apoſtles after his aſcenſion, ſo ſtrongly and ſo often proſecute, to prove him to be the true, proper and natural Son of God: Thus we ſee that as the firſt Perſon the Father is in relation to the ſecond the Son, called <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Another weighty Text about this matter is of the ſame Apoſtle who ſaith <hi>Looking for that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed hope and the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt:</hi>

                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.1.</note> the ſame perſon Jeſus Chriſt, is our Lord, Saviour and God, who <hi>verſe</hi> 11. is called the <hi>Bleſſed God,</hi>

To what I have ſaid already, how the Apoſtle by the great God and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, ſpeaks only of one perſon. I ſhall add, that this is the ſtile of Scripture in other Texts as well as in this; as for inſtance, this, <hi>To the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of the myſtery of God, and of the Father,</hi>

                  <hi>and of Chriſt,</hi> after their way of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting, here the Father is one perſon, and God another; ſo the Father is not God no more than Chriſt, and the Father muſt differ from God as much as Chriſt doth from the Father: So here three different perſons muſt be aſſerted Take notice how in this place the copulative par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle <hi>and,</hi> which they would have to denote different things or perſons is here after the word God, and in the other, after the great God, ſo that I ſee no reaſon, if in that of <hi>Titus</hi> the great God and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt be different perſons, why in this, God and the Father ſhould not be ſo too? This and many other difficulties might
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:52204:141"/>eaſily be removed if men would but give God glory to the acknowledgment of the truth, how Chriſt is the great God and Saviour, and the Father is God, which name in this place to the <hi>Coloſ.</hi> is taken eſſentially, but the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Father and Son are named, to the end <hi>that the hearts of Believers might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full aſſurance of underſtanding to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of the myſtery:</hi> For all theſe are the words of the Text, for certainly 'tis a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of unſpeakable comfort when we are to come to God, whereof the Father is the Spring and firſt Perſon, to hear Chriſt the Mediator nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, thorough whom in our approaches to the Throne of Grace we hope to obtain Mercy and find Grace to help in time of need.</p>
               <p>Theſe deduced out of Scriptures and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons thereupon grounded, to avoid Prolixity I have only pointed at, though they might ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of great enlargements: Some thing more there is remaining, which muſt not be omitted, as being very material, I mean the Texts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our Saviour ſpeaks of his coming down from and going up again to Heaven; whereupon we muſt obſerve how the coming or ſending of God's own Son, doth not ſignifie any local motion from Heaven to Earth, but a manifeſtation of him in the fleſh: God ſent his own Son out of his Boſom, without our Counſel, we deſired it not, we inquired not after it, much leſs deſerved it.</p>
               <p>I muſt not omit to take notice of a falſe infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence they make out of the Text quoted juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, wherein our Saviour is called the firſt born of every Creature, whence they would conclude him to be a Creature when the true inference is this, that he was born before any thing was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſeeing he was the Creator of all, which is the reaſon given in the next verſe, why he calls him the firſt born of every Creature: <hi>For by him were all things created that are in heaven
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:52204:142"/>and that are in carth.</hi> And which is more, at the later end of the verſe, <hi>all things were created by him, and for him.</hi> He created all things for himſelf, which may not be ſaid of any Creature, for if he were a Creature, he had been before himſelf: And if we deſire a farther explanation we have it in the following verſe,<note place="margin">heb. 1.2.6.</note> 
                  <hi>and he is before all things.</hi> And if we compare this place with another, we ſhall find a ſweet harmony, in both, he is called God's Son,<note place="margin">Col. 1.13.</note> yea <hi>his dear Son</hi> in the firſt, in both Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour or maker of the World, ſaith the laſt, <hi>by whom alſo God made the worlds.</hi> As to Creation ſo as to preſervation, for one ſaith, <hi>by him all things conſiſt;</hi> and the other, <hi>by him all things are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held,</hi> and the phraſe in the <hi>Coloſsians,</hi> the <hi>firſt born of every Creature,</hi> is in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Heb.</hi> interpreted by this, <hi>appointed heir of all things,</hi> That is, to be Lord of every Creature or whole Creation; the firſt born is the Heir and Lord: The Elder Brother or Firſt Born is <hi>loco parentis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 12.13.</note> as a Father, and ſo in the ſame Epiſtle, <hi>behold I and the children which God hath given me:</hi> Now the reaſon is clear, and the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence obvious, Chriſt is <hi>before all things,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>all things were created by him,</hi> upon which account he calls himſelf <hi>the beginning of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God,</hi> That is the efficient cauſe, which expreſſions are both joyned together, as being of the ſame importance, <hi>the beginning and firſt born from the dead;</hi>

                  <hi>What and if ye ſhall ſee the Son of man aſcend up where he was before?</hi> which words he ſpoke of himſelf, to remove the offence which what he ſaid about the eating of his fleſh and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his blood had given many of his diſciples, for he ſaith, his words are not literally or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally but ſpiritually to be underſtood, for he was to leave the Earth, and go up into Heaven where he was before, out of which words we may eaſily conclude how Chriſt was in Heaven before he was upon earth, this ſeems to be clear.</p>
               <p>But however they will not agree to it,<note place="margin">Verſ. 32.33, 38, 50.51. Ver. 41.42.</note> firſt they cavil about the place, ſaying that by <hi>where
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:52204:143"/>he was before,</hi> Heaven is not meant, when in this very chapter no leſs than five times, he ſaith he came down from Heaven, which the <hi>Jews</hi> took ſpecial notice of and murmured at: which truth our Saviour had before declared to <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns,</hi> and <hi>No man hath aſcended up to Heaven but he that came down from Heaven, even the Son of Man,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 3.13.</note> 
                  <hi>which is in Heaven;</hi> ſo that although in this verſe, the word Heaven be not named, yet is ſo plainly deſcribed, that there is not the leaſt ground left for any one to doubt of it, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for his Diſciples or others, for what need of his naming again, that which he named ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times before. There is a Text parallel with this,<note place="margin">Joh. 16.28.</note> which doth explain it. <hi>I came forth from the father, and am come into the world; again I leave the world and go to the Father.</hi> To ſay he ſhall aſcend up where he was before, and to return to the place whence he came, is it not the ſame? and had he not declared at ſeveral times that his Father is in Heaven? And if any doubt ſhould remain, 'tis wholly cleared by the execution, and when the thing was fulfilled at his aſcenſion, for, <hi>while they beheld, he was taken up,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 1.9.</note> 
                  <hi>and a cloud received him out of their ſight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this not ſerving their turn, but by theſe Texts being pincht to the quick, to hold out they take another way, which is figuratively to explain the words <hi>where he was before,</hi> and wreſt their proper ſignification into a Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor, that is, <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his mind and thoughts converſed in Heaven, being taken up in Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with thoſe heavenly myſteries that are there; which were ſo preſent unto him, that although he was upon Earth, yet he might be ſaid to be in Heaven; this indeed is a way of pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſenſe of Scriptures, but not a fair one: But if ſo, our Saviour would have ſpoken in the preſent <hi>is,</hi> and not in time paſt <hi>was,</hi> for as they ſay, he continually was taken up with ſuch
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:52204:143"/>thoughts; if continually, then not diſcontinued when at that time he diſcourſed with them: But the word <hi>before,</hi> doth import a relative oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the time wherein our Saviour was in Heaven, and that when he ſpoke upon Earth, beſides that actually and really he was upon Earth when they make him to have been in Heaven, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Thoughts and Meditation, which holds no proportion between his being in Heaven and upon Earth, ſo then Chriſt was really in Heaven, before he came down upon Earth; and as he really and actually aſcended up into it, ſo he really and actually deſcended from thence upon Earth, here are two terms <hi>a quo</hi> and <hi>ad quem,</hi> as he could not go up to Heaven but from the Earth, ſo he could not come down upon the Earth but from Heaven: and is there the leaſt ground in the whole Chapter to think Chriſt's intention was to entertain them with his having been in Heaven in <hi>Idea</hi> and Meditation? when his deſign was to ſhew, how, what he had ſaid of being the Author of Reſurrection and Life, and the manner of it by means of eating his fleſh was a thing not to give them offence, nor impoſſible: Conſidering what he was, originally from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, therefore not to be conſidered as a meer man, but ſuch a one as was far more divine and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full than any man.</p>
               <p>They finding this will not do, yet to diſpute the ground as long as they can, they forged in a Dream, for otherwiſe it cannot be, a very ſtrange adventure; that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was in Heaven before he was upon Earth, ſeemeth undeniable; therefore becauſe they dare not give him the lye, they would mince the matter thus; how Chriſt between his Birth and Death, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he preached went up into Heaven, where for a while he remained to be better inſtructed by the Father, in the things which he was to teach mankind, after which he came down again; but there is not the leaſt ground but only fancy for
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:52204:144"/>it: The Evangeliſts do give us an account of moſt paſſages of Chriſt's Life, and how could they all four have forgotten this which is one of the moſt important that might have befallen him in that kind. The Evangeliſts <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> in their four firſt Chapters, relate many things belonging to that time, as not only his birth, but alſo his Circumciſion on the eighth day, and his being carryed to the Temple to be preſented to the Lord, received by <hi>Simeon,</hi> ſpoken of by <hi>Anna</hi> a Propheteſs, adored by the Wiſe Men, carryed into <hi>Egypt,</hi> his return to <hi>Nazareth,</hi> his being found in the Temple ſitting in the midſt of the Doctors, asking them que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions; his being ſubject to <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary;</hi> baptized of <hi>John;</hi> tempted in the Wilderneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not one word about this pretended aſcenſion. How came it that he was not miſſed by any? This they would to have been in imitation of <hi>Moſes,</hi> whom God called up to the Mount: That it was ſo with <hi>Moſes,</hi> we read in the word, but nothing like it of our Saviour: And when God is ſilent our mouth ſhould be ſtopped, and nothing allowed to fancy or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination: beſides when <hi>Moſes</hi> was called up, the people had publick notice given them of it, and by God's command, he took <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Sons and Seventy of the Elders, all the people ſaw the glory of God upon the Mount; and when <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> came back, all <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſaw him with his face ſhining, none of which things can be ſaid of this pretended Aſcenſion of chriſt's, whereof there are no witneſſes, not ſo much as any of his Diſciples, as he had in his Trasſiguration, which three E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts give an exact account of. Which though important, yet not ſo conſiderable as this which could not be performed without a great Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle whether he had been carryed up only in Soul, for then his Soul had been ſeparated from the Body, ſo death muſt have followed, or whether in Body and Soul, the Body could not
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:52204:144"/>have been ſuſtain'd in the Air without a Miracle: And during that time, where were his Diſciples? This certainly ſhould have made a great Gap in the Hiſtory of his Life; which we cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in any of the Evangeliſts, no, nor in thoſe that have written his Life, from his Birth to his Death, Reſurrection, and Aſcenſion. St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith of the Goſpel he had written, how he had made a <hi>Treatiſe of all that Jeſus begun both to do and to teach:</hi> Yet not a word of this,<note place="margin">Acts 1.1.</note> as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there was no neceſſity for Chriſt to go up to <hi>Know,</hi> as they ſay, his Father's Will, which might have been communicated unto him, as to <hi>Moſes, John Baptiſt,</hi> without going up to Heaven, in caſe he had not known it; but he knew it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: At his Baptiſm the Heavens were opened unto him; the Father had highly owned him; the Holy Ghoſt was deſcended upon him, ſo that <hi>he return'd from,</hi> Jordan <hi>full of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 4.1.</note> wherefore there was no need of his going, and ſo the Cauſe ceaſing, ſo muſt the Effect; ſo that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo it had been prepoſterous, after what happen'd in his Baptiſm, for him to have gone up into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon ſuch an Errand: Beſides that, we are aſſured he enter'd but once into the holy place,<note place="margin">Heb. 9.12.</note> Hereby we ſee how, if we were willing to take it, that ſort of Men would be ready to put upon us every Suggeſtion of theirs for an Argument, every Argument for a Law, yea, and every Dream for a Revelation. Tho' our Saviour here calls himſelf Son of Man, and not Son of God, it doth not in the leaſt prejudice what we ſay; for if he had call'd himſelf Son of God, it had been a begging of the Queſtion, for they would not own him to be ſuch: And this ſheweth the better the Oneneſs of the Perſon, when there is a Communication of the Idioms, when in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that which is proper to one Nature is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the other. Chriſt, according to the Fleſh, was never in Heaven before his Aſcenſion, but according to the Spirit, that is his Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:52204:145"/>he was. Here our bleſſed Saviour calling himſelf Son of Man, may allude to, with intent to make Men take notice of what is ſpoken of himſelf by the Prophet;<note place="margin">Dan. 7.13, 14.</note> 
                  <hi>I ſaw in the night Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and behold, one like the Son of Man came with the Clouds of Heaven, and came to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient of days, and they brought him near before him. And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages ſhould ſerve him: his dominion is an everlaſting dominion,</hi> &amp;c. This is an exact Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of his Aſcenſion.</p>
               <p>One thing more they have to ſay, and 'tis the Example of <hi>Paul</hi>'s having been caught up to the third Heaven; but muſt it, from what hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.2.</note> follow, that the ſame muſt needs have befaln the Lord Jeſus? That indeed we read of <hi>Paul,</hi> therefore we ought to believe; but of Chriſt we read no ſuch thing: Yet for all that we never read that either <hi>Paul</hi> was from Heaven, or came down, as we read it of Chriſt very often. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of that with the greateſt modeſty in the World, for fear he ſhould ſeem to exalt himſelf; but our Lord, without any ambiguity or fear that Men would think, he takes too much upon himſelf, doth ſpeak loud, highly declares and often proclaims himſelf to be the Son of God, equal with him, ſent by the Father, deſcended from Heaven, where he is again to return, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This he owned openly, and when he had ſaid to the man ſick of the Palſie, <hi>Thy ſins are forgiven thee,</hi> ſome of the <hi>Scribes</hi> having, ſaid within themſelves, This man bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemeth. Chriſt called <hi>evil</hi> theſe Thoughts of theirs;<note place="margin">Mat. 9.4.</note> 
                  <hi>Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another place in this ſame Chapter already mention'd,<note place="margin">Joh. 6.38.</note> and to our purpoſe, is this: <hi>I came down from Heaven not to do mine own will, but the will of him that ſent me.</hi> The words, taken in their natural ſignification, are plain enough, and admit of no difficulty. Chriſt ſpeaks of
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:52204:145"/>himſelf; what Heaven is we know 'tis as his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural place, whence he came down into a ſtate of Humiliation, in taking upon him our human Nature; the End of his coming down was to do his Father's Will, not his; tho' we muſt not think that when he did his Father's Will, he acted any thing againſt his own, for whatſoever he did and ſuffer'd was voluntarily, as he had ſaid long before by the Prophet, <hi>I delight to do thy will:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 40.5, 6, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Sacrifice and Offering thou didſt not deſire. Then ſaid I, Lo, I come.</hi> And when the Will of his Father was executed, and the Work he gave him to do finiſh'd, he went back, if we may ſo ſay, home again, into Heaven. The Difficulty then lies not in the words, but about the ſence: Chriſt, who ſpoke the words, is true; tho' every ſence that is attempted to be given to the words be not true, yet a true ſence there is. He makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Perſon, and of his Fleſh; his Perſon is that which came down from Heaven; his Fleſh is that which was formed in the Virgins Womb, that indeed did not come from Heaven; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſpeaks of his Fleſh and Blood to intimate his Death, and that Life which he promiſeth to thoſe that eat his Fleſh: He procureth it in two ways, by Merit or Impetration, and by Efficacy or Application: The Merit by his Death conſiſts in the Dignity of the Perſon which ſuffer'd it; the Application and Efficacy, in the Spirit which is in the Perſon. By the Oppoſition he makes between himſelf and the Manna, he ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently declares, that he really came down from Heaven.</p>
               <p>The Adverſaries would have the coming down from Heaven to ſignifie no more than to proceed from God, which to confirm they make uſe of ſome Texts, as when our Saviour asked the Chief Prieſts, whence was the Baptiſm of <hi>John,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 21.25.</note> 
                  <hi>was it from Heaven, or of Men?</hi> Thus every good and perfect Gift is ſaid to be <hi>from above, and to come down from the Father of light.</hi> Again,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:52204:146"/>
                  <hi>This Wiſdom deſcendeth not from above.</hi> Thus <hi>John</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Jam. 1.17. &amp; 3.15. Rev. 21.2.</note> he <hi>ſaw the new</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>coming down from God out of Heaven:</hi> But none of theſe places is to the purpoſe, for they are about Things, and the Queſtion is about Perſons: Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture makes no diſſiculty to ſay, that Things whereof God is immediate Author come down from Heaven, there being no danger to ſay ſo, but it never ſaith it of Perſons. In the Word of God, none beſides Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, and Angels, none, tho' never created or born, in ſo eminent a manner, is ſaid to be come down from Heaven; neither <hi>Adam,</hi> nor <hi>Eve,</hi> nor <hi>Iſaac</hi> the Son of a Special promiſe, and whoſe Birth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the age of <hi>Abraham</hi> and of <hi>sarah,</hi> was very extraordinary. But that Chriſt came down from Heaven in a manner different from what is expreſſed in thoſe places, it appeareth out of the fore-quoted place, <hi>What and if ye ſhall ſee the Son aſcend up where he was before?</hi> whereby is implied, that he was in Heaven before he came down from it; which he confirmeth in that other place, No Man hath aſcended up to Heaven but he that came down from Heaven, even the Son of Man, which is in Heaven; whereof the ſence is made known by the deſign of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Nicodemus</hi> about being born again and Regeneration, ſaith, <hi>If I have told you earthly things,</hi> and of ſuch as are done in earth, which by your own experience you may ſee and know, <hi>yet ye believe me not, how ſhall ye believe if I tell you of heavenly things,</hi> that is, ſuch as are or be done in Heaven, which ye neither can know of your ſelves nor by any one elſe? but by me, for I have been in Heaven, and none elſe?

               <p>Our Lord's words, <hi>I came down from Heaven to do the will of him that ſent me,</hi> do certainly contain more than barely, I am created by the wonderful Counſel and Power of God; herein he ſpeaks as would an Embassador ſent by his Prince, wherefore the words imply, firſt, that

And if it had not been in this ſence, the <hi>Jews</hi> would not have murmur'd as they did; as indeed there had been no cauſe for it: And we do not in the leaſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive he goes about to ſhew they were miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to give his words ſuch as ſence, but on the contrary he goeth on to confirm what he had ſaid, according to the ſence they gave it, and that without any ambiguity, but plainly and downright, tho' he knew he thereby did run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a great danger,<note place="margin">Matth. 13.55, 56, &amp; John 6.42.</note> for the Jews did not know how to reconcile what they knew of him: <hi>Is not this the Carpenter's Son?

               <p>They were ſo pleaſed with the Miracle of the five Barley Loaves and two ſmall Fiſhes, that they would have taken him by force, and made him a King; and after he was gone, they could not be at reſt till they again had found him out, and then he ſaid, they follow'd him only out of love to their Belly, becauſe they had eaten and were filled; whereupon out of his earneſt deſire for their good, he takes occaſion to exhort them, to mind not that Meat <hi>that periſheth, but that which endureth unto everlaſting life, which the Son of man,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>ſhall give unto you:</hi> And then he

                  <hi>he is from God,</hi> afterwards he attributes unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a quickening Power, and to give everlaſting Life, for he doth not ſay, <hi>he that believeth</hi> in God, but <hi>on me;</hi> neither doth he ſay God.<note place="margin">V. 47.</note> but <hi>I will raiſe him up at the laſt day.</hi> Could the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have more highly and ſtately ſpoken of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,<note place="margin">V. 40.</note> or aſſumed a greater Power than he doth? whereby we ſee, this he ſaith to draw Men, not to the Father, but to himſelf, as the Spring of Eternal Life, whereby he inſinuates himſelf to be ſuch a one as is far more potent and excellent than Man, upon which account he is truly and properly ſaid to be come down from <hi>Heaven,</hi> or elſe he had not anſwerd the Jews Objection to the purpoſe: Which 'tis very unworthy for any one to ſay.</p>
               <p>This matter we ſhall conclude with one Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more out of theſe words: <hi>I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world:</hi>

                  <hi>again I leave the world, and go to the Father.</hi> Where is the Father? In Heaven. Where is the World? On Earth. So then Chriſt was with the Father in Heaven before he was in the World on Earth. This laſt Text I joyn with the two foregoing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſame purpoſe, becauſe a threefold Knot is not eaſily untied. The words are ſo clear,<note place="margin">V. 29.</note> that thereupon his Diſciples ſaid, <hi>Lo, now ſpeakeſt thou plainly.</hi> 'Tis to be wiſh'd every one was of their opinion, as there is cauſe for it:<note place="margin">V. 30.</note> 
                  <hi>By this we believe</hi> (ſaid they) <hi>that thou cameſt forth from God.</hi> This they ſaid themſelves, and the Lord ſaith ſo of them, <hi>They have known ſurely that I came out from thee, and that thou didſt ſend me:</hi> But neither <hi>Socinus,</hi> nor none of his Kidney, can ſay and prove that they believed not there was a Divine Nature in Chriſt: They explain the words, <hi>I came forth from the Father,</hi> only to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:52204:148"/>that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was a Man ſent from God upon ſome ſpecial Errand, juſt as he ſent his Diſciples into the World,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 4.1</note> or <hi>as falſe Prophets are</hi> ſaid to be <hi>gone into the world.</hi> We know the Faith of his Apoſtles was weak, but true, and was encreaſed by degrees; they ſometimes doubted of things, as may be Chriſt's Reſurrection, but this doth not argue that there was no Faith in them, for there was, tho' ſtaggering and imperfect, which our Saviour ſtrengthened and themſelves were ſenſible of, when they ſaid unto him, <hi>Lord, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our Faith;</hi> which we read ſo actually effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in <hi>Thomas,</hi> who more than any one elſe doubted of this Reſurrection, that at laſt he gave an authentick Teſtimony of his Faith concerning it when he called him, <hi>my Lord,</hi> and <hi>my God;</hi> and before that time, <hi>Peter,</hi> in their name, had given eminent evidence of their Faith about him, when he ſaid,<note place="margin">John 6.68, 69.</note> 
                  <hi>Lord, to whom ſhall we go? Thou heſt the words of eternal life: and we believe and are ſure that thou art that Chriſt, the Son of the living God.</hi> After ſo ſolemn a Declaration, how dare any man ſay his Diſciples did not believe any thing of Divine Nature in him? As to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, he ſent them into the World, but he dwelt upon Earth, but his Father ſent him upon Earth when himſelf was in Heaven: And this we may ſay, that as the Diſciples were with Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſent them, ſo he was with the Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſent him. As to the falſe Prophets, they were gone out into the World, but whence?

               </p>
               <p>One thing more I ſhall obſerve upon this Text, that if Chriſt really aſcended up into Heaven, as he did unqueſtionably after his Reſurrection, ſo he really deſcended from thence before his Incarnation; and if he deſcended, then he was before he deſcended; this, as ſaid juſt before, his Diſciples believed literally, not in a Metaphor or Figure; and that they well underſtood his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:52204:148"/>our Saviour confirms, when he ſaith, <hi>v.</hi> 31, <hi>Do ye now believe,</hi> and what? <hi>That I came from the Father, and muſt return to him; and that I know all thing,</hi> which none but God can. Here I muſt give a general and neceſſary Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt <hi>Socinian</hi> far-fetch'd, and falſe gloſſes. Indeed, if admittance be given to all their Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories, there can be no room left for literal and proper ſence: So the deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> poſſeſſion of <hi>Canaan,</hi> carrying into Captivity, ſhall not be Matters of Fact, and we may doubt whether there was ever a <hi>Noah,</hi> a Flood, or an Ark, ſuch men as <hi>Aaron, Moſes, Joſhua,</hi> for 'tis poſſible to turn all theſe into Allegories. We know in Scripture there are ſome, but to turn every thing into't is a great Abuſe: When a Text expreſſes plainly a literal ſence, we muſt not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our heads to ſcrew it up into an Allegory; nor when the Diſcourſe is doctrinal, and the words in it uſual, proper, and ſuited to the things intended to be expreſſed, this indeed is what <hi>Peter</hi> calls a <hi>reſting the Scriptures to their own deſtruction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The later part of the Verſe doth explain the firſt, for the words ſignifie Chriſt's Aſcenſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven; they were ſpoken upon the occaſion of Chriſt's inſtructing, encouraging, and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his Diſciples to that Separation which was ſuddenly to happen by his Death; after which, tho' he ſhewed himſelf alive by many infallible Proofs, being ſeen of them forty days, and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the things pertaining to the Kingdom of God, yet he converſed not with them in the ſame manner as before his Paſſion.<note place="margin">Acts 1.2</note> Now this occaſion which they were ſpoken upon, ſheweth how he diſcourſed about leaving the World, going to his Father, and aſcending into Heaven, which reaily and viſibly happen'd forty days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Reſurrection. By theſe Expreſſions, which were familiar with him, of going up or aſcending to the Father, he ſignified the ſame
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:52204:149"/>thing; and tho' the Father doth fill up Heaven, which is his Throne, and Earth his Footſtool, yet in Scripture he is ſaid to ſit and dwell in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as in his home;<note place="margin">Joh. 14.2.</note> wherefore our Saviour calls Heaven <hi>his Father's Houſe.</hi> Now, as this later part of the verſe ſignifieth Chriſt's Aſcenſion from the Earth to the Father, ſo the firſt ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth his coming down from Heaven upon Earth. Again, the Oppoſition which is ſeen between both parts, as, <hi>I came forth from the Father,</hi> with, <hi>and go to the Father;</hi> and, <hi>I am come into the World,</hi> with, <hi>again I leave the World;</hi> do ſhew, that if to come from the Father doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note to be ſent from Heaven to Earth by the Father; ſo to go to the Father ſignifieth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that, namely, to go from Earth up to Heaven to the Father. <hi>Chriſt</hi> leaving the World, is gone to the Father; and going to the Father, he hath left the World: wherefore to go to the Father, and leave the World, are the ſame. So likewiſe, Chriſt coming forth from the Father, came into the World, and coming into the World, he came forth from the Father: And theſe two kinds of Expreſſions ſignifie the ſame thing;<note place="margin">Chap. 13.3.</note> and as <hi>he was come from God,</hi> ſo <hi>he went to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This coming from the Father, and coming into the World, do imply, firſt, a ſending, as the Lord declareth it;<note place="margin">John 8.42.</note> 
                  <hi>I proceeded forth, and came from God: neither came I of my ſelf, but he ſent me.</hi> And then ſomething poſterior to the Miſſion, and as it were belonging to the execution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, for if one ſhould ask, Wherefore came Chriſt into the World? it would be well anſwer'd to ſay, Becauſe the Father ſent him: So that he who is ſent, muſt come from him that ſent him, to the place whereunto he is ſent. Then the words, I came from the Father, muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the execution of the ſending, rather than the ſending itſelf. It is a wrong ſence gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as to apply them to a divine production; I
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:52204:149"/>came from the Father, that is, I am miraculouſly produced by the Father: This Expoſition doth confound things that are different, for none can be ſent before he hath a Being, but that's produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced which hath no Being; Production is before Sending: Thus the words muſt ſignifie, that Chriſt return'd to the place whence he came, and aſcended into that whence he deſcended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. This he went about to inculcate into the Mind of the Jews, in the oppoſition he makes of his Origin with theirs; <hi>Ye are from benedth,</hi>

                  <hi>I am from above: ye are of this world, I am not of this world,</hi> but from the Father, not from Earth, but from Heaven: He was not in the World by a natural neceſſity, but voluntarily, and by a determined counſel, he came into't as Embaſſador from his Father, to reveal unto Men the Doctrin and Means of Salvation, and for Judgment;<note place="margin">Chap. 9.39.</note> 
                  <hi>For judgment am I come into this world;</hi> and all the while he was here, even very betimes, he mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what he came about: Unto his Mother, after ſhe found him in the Temple, and asking him, <hi>Why haſt thou thus dealt with us?</hi> he anſwer'd, <hi>How is it that ye ſought me? wiſt ye not that I muſt be about my Father's buſineſs?</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Now, to ſtrengthen what I have ſaid to prove our Lords Divinity, before I proceed to anſwer <hi>Objecting,</hi> I ſhall add what followeth upon the forementioned Head of the Angel in the Old Teſtament, I mean, the increated Angel, whoſe Perſon in appearance is Man, in office Angel, in nature God, the ſecond Perſon of the moſt holy Trinity. I ſhall ſomewhat inſiſt upon a moſt notable place, and much to our purpoſe, though I already ſaid ſomething about it, for I can not willing to lay aſide a ſtrong and very uſeful wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon becauſe I made uſe of it before, for when once it hath been try'd, we are the ſurer of, and may better depend upon it.

<pb n="249" facs="tcp:52204:150"/>ſatisfied with. Who and what this Angel was,<note place="margin">Chap. 23.20, 21, 22.</note> we have it in the Book of <hi>Exodus,</hi> with the End for which he was to go before, namely, to guide them; and 'tis thus expreſſed: <hi>Behold, I ſend an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.</hi> But hear the Charge he gives them concerning this Angel; <hi>Beware of him, and obey his voice: provoke him not, for he will not pardon your tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions: for my name is in him.</hi> Such terms doth the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> uſe when he ſpeaks, of himſelf.

               <p>The Caution here given to take heed, <hi>have a care and beware of him,</hi> as if he had ſaid, take heed to thy ſelf in thy Carriage before him; this, I ſay, joyned with the Command to obey his Voice, is very remarkable: The abſolute Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which God requires them to yield unto the Angel, is due to God alone, and is never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the Creature, only to himſelf, for his Voice is God's Voice, and when he ſpeaketh, God ſpeaketh, as the words of <hi>v.</hi> 22. do intimate; <hi>If thou ſhalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I ſpeak, then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies.</hi> The Angels Voice, and all that God ſpeaketh, is the fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

The Lord never ſo expreſly charged any People or Perſon not to provoke any created Angel or Man as here he doth, <hi>Provoke him not,</hi> offend and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe him not; why? <hi>For he will not pardon your Tranſgreſſions,</hi> Rebellions or Sins in Scripture Phraſe, for <hi>Sin is the tranſgreſſion of the law.</hi> So then, to diſobey and to provoke this Angel, is to ſin; and this very ſame Angel hath right and power, if he will, to pardon Sin, which none

Now, the Perſon of the Word, in his divine nature, exiſted before he was made Fleſh, or elſe how was it poſſible it ſhould be tempted at that time?

When <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of aſcending, he acts not the Part of an Hiſtorian, but of a Prophet, and this is of an Aſcenſion joyned with a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, and leading of Captives, which doth not belong to that of <hi>Sinai:</hi> Neither do we read any where that God aſcended into Heaven from <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai;</hi> but Chriſt having obtained victory over Death, the Grave, and all his and our Enemies, went up to Heaven; which cannot be ſaid of the Ark: But the Aſcenſion here ſpoken of, as <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> doth interpret it, relateth to
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:52204:153"/>him <hi>who deſcended firſt into the lower parts of the earth,</hi> that is, to Chriſt, who <hi>aſcended far above all Heavens, that he might fit all things,</hi> if we may take an Apoſtle's Interpretation of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; and it was Chriſt's or the Son of God's Voice that ſhook the Earth or Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> as we may read it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.26.</p>
               <p>Before I leave this matter, to what I ſaid upon another Text, which is much to our purpoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this Angel, concerning <hi>Jacob,</hi> I ſhall farther add, how the ſame perſon that appeared unto him was in the ſhape of a man; <hi>There wreſtled a man with him,</hi> Gen. 32.24. <hi>2ly,</hi> That ſame when <hi>Jacob</hi> was about bleſſing <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Children,<note place="margin">Gen. 48.16.</note> he called an Angel. The <hi>3d</hi> thing is, That he is expreſly ſaid to be God Lord of Hoſts, by <hi>Hoſea,</hi> for the Prophet ſpeaking of <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſaid, <hi>He had power with God,</hi> upon the occaſion of his wreſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and added, <hi>Yea, he had power over the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, and prevailed; he wept and made ſupplication unto him; he found him in Bethel, and there he ſpake with us, even the Lord God of hoſts: the Lord is his memorial,</hi> Hoſ. 12.3, 4, 5. So hence it appears how the Perſon who at <hi>Bethel</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, when he fled from the Face of his Brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> Gen. 28.13, compared with <hi>Chap.</hi> 35.1, and wreſtled with him, when coming from <hi>Lanban</hi> he had paſſed over the Ford <hi>Jabbock;</hi> that ſame, I ſay, was God, the Angel, and the Lord of Hoſts. This happened when <hi>Jacob</hi> and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily were going into <hi>Canaan,</hi> whereof the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion had been promiſed him and his Poſterity; upon the very borders he is met by his Adverſary his Brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> who had a pretence to that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and therefore came againſt him with a power which of himſelf he was not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, which made him afraid, as we read <hi>v.</hi> 11, wherefore upon ſuch a tryal, to ſtrengthen his Faith, and make him lay hold the faſter on the Promiſe,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.20.</note> he <hi>in whom all the promiſes are yea and
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:52204:154"/>Amen,</hi> the Son of God, Jeſus Chriſt, appeared unto him in the ſhape of a man, becauſe in his Seed were the Promiſes made; but this man in appearance, was God in effect and nature, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Jacob</hi> did ſolemnly pray to him for his Bleſſing in the time of the wreſtling, and would not reſt till he had bleſſed him, which he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained <hi>v.</hi> 29, and in remembrance of this, <hi>Jacob</hi> called the name of the place <hi>Peniel,</hi> becauſe he had ſeen God face to face. This ſolemn meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with much Comfort and Thankfulneſs <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> remembred when he bleſſed <hi>Joſeph</hi> and his two Sons, in theſe moſt remarkable words, <hi>God, before whom my Fathers</hi> Abraham <hi>and</hi> Iſaac <hi>did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day, the Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bleſs the Lads.</hi> The God of his Fathers the God that ſed him all his life-time, and the Angel which redeemed him from all evil, is but one and the ſame: And the Name <hi>Redeemer</hi> is proper to Chriſt, the ſecond Perſon of the holy Trinity. All theſe are irrefragable Truths, which <hi>Socinians</hi> can effectually ſay nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, tho' out of the <hi>Rabbis</hi> or Jewiſh Doctors Writings they have been ſcrewing up whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they thought might ſerve their turn; thus they were not aſhamed to borrow Weapons from Chriſts ſworn Enemies.</p>
               <p>But before I leave off this Point about Angels, whether the Creator or created ones, for the glory of the Son of God, I muſt ſay how, tho' theſe be called Sons of God, mighty in Power, and excellent in created Glory, yet when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with God,<note place="margin">Job 15.15. &amp; 4.18. Iſa. 6.3. John 12.40.</note> 'tis ſaid, they are <hi>not pure in his ſight,</hi> and <hi>he chargeth them with folly,</hi> and <hi>they cover their faces at the brightneſs of his glory,</hi> as not being able nor worthy to look upon t. And that place about Divine Glory, as I already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, we know to belong to our Saviour, who is called <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>King</hi> of Glory, becauſe
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:52204:154"/>all Glory is in and from him, as its true Spring and proper Center; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24, compared with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.8. Hence it is that at his coming into the World all Angels were commanded to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him, which was performed in their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on his Birth, proclamation of his Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and celebrating the Glory of God on that account, and afterwards declaring his Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and confirming his Aſcenſion, even mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring unto him after the Temptation, and when he was in his Agony: And whilſt Angels are called God's Miniſters, who ought to worſhip Chriſt the Son as their Maker, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the Son he ſaith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever;</hi> to ſhew that there is as much and as great a difference between the Son and Angels as there is between God and Angels, between the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and the Creature; for indeed, in that ſame place <hi>the Heavens</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>the work of his hands;</hi> ſo no compariſon to be made between the Son and Angels, the nobleſt of all Creatures. The Name <hi>Elohim,</hi> abſolutely uſed, is never in Scripture given to any ſingular Angel or Man, which is the ſame as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> with the Article by the Apoſtle given the Son; ſo he is denoted by that Name as the true God by Nature:; And this ſame hath a Kingdom, ſignified by the Royal Marks of a Scepter and a Throne, whereunto Eternity is annexed, for 'tis <hi>for ever and ever,</hi> whereby its duration or laſting is expreſſed; ſo is his manner of adminiſtration with righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>His ſcepter is a ſcepter of righteouſneſs;</hi> and, to ſhew his preparation for that admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of his, 'tis ſaid, <hi>He loved righteouſneſs and hated iniquity.</hi> Now the Throne is not for the Servants, but for the Son, becauſe the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom thereby denoted is not theirs but his, who indeed is graciouſly pleaſed to promiſe his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, that <hi>at the laſt day they ſhall ſit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Iſrael;</hi> that is, they ſhall participate only at the laſt day with
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:52204:155"/>him in his Kingly Power,<note place="margin">Mat. 19.28.</note> and in ſome degree be made partakers of his Glory, with an Intereſt in his Kingdom, which he is pleaſed to give them: in the mean time the Throne is not theirs, but his.</p>
               <p>Here I muſt take notice how, for preventing many Errors, raſh and falſe Opinions, 'tis to be wiſhed men would follow the Apoſtles Practiſe in this place, who abounding in quotations, gives us a Rule and an Example to do ſo, for with comparing Scriptures one with another, we come to be acquainted with God's Mind and Will in them, for by what is ſpoken of Angels in one place, and of the Son in another, we are taught what to believe of him and of them: They who follow not this Rule, are apt to frame in their Heads haſty, wrong, and falſe notions about God's Mind, eſpecially in the matters we are now upon. And what is it that gives the Throne of the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> Unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs and Eternity, but his divine Nature? The words of the Pſalmiſt, whence the Apoſtle draws his Argument, do not belong to <hi>Solomon,</hi> for the words, <hi>O God,</hi> do not relate to him, nor theſe, <hi>Thy throne is for ever and ever,</hi> for he reigned but forty years; nor to his Succeſſors, who went off the Stage at or about the time of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity. We know how in ſome things <hi>Solomon</hi> was a Type of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but it doth not follow that every thing relating to the <hi>Antitype</hi> ſhould belong unto the <hi>Type,</hi> for 'tis enough for the Type ſo to repreſent and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow out the Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that what the Prophet would teach concerning him ſhould be ſpoken of the Type, whereby he was repreſented; for the Antitype is what the Spirit of God ever chiefly aimed at: So, tho the Type and Antitype agreed in ſome things, in others there was a vaſt difference between them. But, that in this place the Apoſtle doth interpret thoſe words of the Son of God <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> it appears out of
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:52204:155"/>
                  <hi>v.</hi> 8, but unto the Son he ſaith, <hi>Thy throne, O God, &amp;c.</hi> And 'tis in that Party but vain and idle words, to go about to perſwade us, that the Apoſtle did not ſay what he ſaid, and which is written for our inſtruction: And with us they ſhould take notice how it is ſaid, <hi>When he bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his firſt-born into the world, let all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of God worſhip him;</hi> before he was ſet upon his Throne after his Aſcenſion: So the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand was antecedent to that Seſſion of his up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Throne in Heaven. And this ſitting at the right hand of God, puts me in mind now to add ſomething to what I ſaid upon that Text, and it is this, how we and our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ought to conſider the uſefulneſs and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of that Teſtimony,<note place="margin">Pſal. 110.1.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord ſaid unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand;</hi> for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Dignity and Authority of <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is evidenced by the frequent quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of it in the New Teſtament, as by our Saviour himſelf, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.42; by <hi>Peter,</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.34, 35; and by <hi>Paul,</hi> in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 55.28.

When the Goſpel was preached by our bleſſed Saviour, and by his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, many refuſed to receive and believe it, though it was very good, and not contrary to Reaſon: They that are Servants to their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Reaſon, do not receive that which is above it; and in this matter there are other Cauſes of the blindneſs and hatred of Jews and Turks. Hereticks ought to be aſhamed to joyn with Infidels, to overthrow a Doctrin which in all Ages hath by general Conſent been lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as the Foundation of our Religion.

The <hi>ſecond,</hi> A thing is or is not: But, ſay they, you ſay the Paterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Fatherhood really to be the ſame with the Eſſence, and the Eſſence really with the Filia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; therefore the Paternity is the ſame with the Filiation or Sonſhip, and is not the ſame. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By the Rule of the <hi>Tertium,</hi> the things that are the ſame in another, or in a third, are the ſame among themſelves. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> 'Tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Principle of the expoſitory Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſm, which is this; The Eſſence is the Father, the Eſſence is the Son, therefore the Father is the Son. In theſe four things, ſay they, your Doctrin is contrary to Reaſon.</p>
               <p>In anſwer to this, Firſt, in <hi>general</hi> we ſay, that ſuch things as gainſay the Principles of true Reaſon are contrary to it, but not thoſe which exceed and are far above Reaſon. Now things objected againſt by <hi>Antitrinitarians</hi> do neither fight againſt nor contradict Reaſon, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are above it; then theſe Principles or Rules are ill applied, becauſe they compare God, the Author of Nature, with natural things. Now we anſwer in particular, as to the <hi>Firſt</hi> Axiom, It is not overthrown, inaſmuch as there is no oppoſition according to the ſame thing; nothing that is one, as it is one, and in the ſame reſpect may be called three, but God is one in Nature and three in Perſons; the manner of ſubſiſting doth diſtinguiſh the Perſons, but multiplieth not the Eſſence. In the <hi>Second</hi> there is no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, for the Paternity and Filiation are diſtinguiſhed among themſelves in one way, and from the Eſſence in another; it is only a modal diſtinction between Paternity and Filiation, the leaſt degree of diſtinction is between the thing and the manner of it, between the Eſſence and the Paternity or Filiation, wherefore Eſſence, Paternity and Filiation are diſtinct, but not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent things: We never ſaid 'tis the ſame, but
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:52204:157" rendition="simple:additions"/>'tis of the ſame, and becauſe they are of the ſame, they differ not as thing and thing. And if the Adverſaries would argue thus, the Father is the ſame with the Eſſence, the Eſſence is the ſame with the Son, therefore the Father is the ſame with the Son, they would thereby conclude nothing againſt us; for we affirm the Father and Son not at all to differ as to the Eſſence: but the ſelf-being of the Eſſence doth not conclude for the ſelf-being of the Perſon; wherefore we ſay it is and it is not in a different reſpect, upon a different account. As to the <hi>Third,</hi> the Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and the Filiation are not the ſame with the Eſſence, but Father and Son have the ſame Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. Now their Rule doth not here fit their Purpoſe; for, if they ſay Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>ity and Filiation are the ſame with or in the Eſſence, it is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous; for Paternity and Filiation are <hi>modes</hi> or manners of the thing, that is, in the Eſſence are not the ſame with the Eſſence, becauſe the thing and manner of it are not altogether the ſame: But if they ſay Father and Son are the ſame in <hi>uno tortio</hi> in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="263" facs="tcp:52204:157" rendition="simple:additions"/>judge of an infinite Nature by a finite one, when the reaſon of both is very different: here the infinite Eſſence is individual, becauſe infinite, communicable without being multiplied in many perſons.</p>
               <p>To the ſame purpoſe they object in another manner; <hi>God is One, therefore cannot be Three:</hi> ſo there is none but the Father. The Anſwer is eaſie, and we already have ſaid ſomething to it; that which is one cannot be two or three in the ſame reſpect, it cannot be one and many in the ſame ſenſe: What Chriſt ſays,<note place="margin">John. 10.30.</note> 
                  <hi>I and my Father are one,</hi> is moſt true; ſo that <hi>One</hi> is related to the Nature, and <hi>I</hi> and <hi>Father</hi> to the Perſons; ſo then God is one as to the Nature, and three as to the Perſons. Seeing the Nature or Godhead cannot be multiplied, it follows, that the Perſons and Subſiſtences only are multiplied. They ſay farther, A ſimple Eſſence cannot be of three Perſons, otherwiſe it will be divided or multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied: But though this be true of finite, it is not ſo of an infinite Eſſence; neither doth it follow, that becauſe the Eſſence is common to three Perſons, it may be common to more, for it were contrary to divine Revelation, which only mentioneth one Father, one Son, and one Holy ghoſt; the Father God, the Son God, the Holy Ghoſt God, yet not three Gods, but only one God. Neither doth it follow, that becauſe divine Eſſence is common to three Perſons, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every Perſon ſhall be common, and becauſe the Perſons are not common, therefore the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture muſt not be. This is the cauſe of their Miſtake, that they do not mind the diſtinction of the Perſon from the Eſſence; for tho they differ not <hi>really,</hi> yet <hi>rationally</hi> they be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed: It doth follow to ſay, if the Eſſence be common to three Perſons, therefore the Perſons are common, no more than to ſay, if <hi>Abel</hi> hath his Nature from <hi>Adam,</hi> and is a Man, therefore he hath his Poſterity, and is a Father from him.
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:52204:158" rendition="simple:additions"/>The things, ſay they, that are ſeparately num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered are not one in number and eſſence; but the Father and the Son are ſeparately numbered, and are by themſelves called one, as one God, one Mediator, one God and Father, one Lord; wherefore Father and Son are not one only God or one Eſſence. But I ſay, Numeration doth not import a diſtinction of Eſſence; for in finite things Eſſences being multiplied, they are recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned individual, not in relation to the Eſſence, but to the Perſons; that which is numbered is one, neither is it one without the Eſſence, yet for all that it is not one eſſentially, or by his own Eſſence ſeparated from any other whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever: ſo then, when the Father and Son are num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, they are not ſo eſſentially, but perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; alſo they are the ſame in number and eſſence, (contrary to what is objected) whereof one is ſaid to be with the other, as <hi>the word was with God,</hi> for in God to be one with another, is only an hypoſtatical or perſonal diſtinction; for as to be one with another doth import a diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo the ſame Evangeliſt ſheweth the Eſſence of both to be but one and the ſame, when he addeth, <hi>the word was God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Furthermore they argue thus; The Father and the Son are really diſtinguiſhed, for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is abſolutely God, that is the divine Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; for, ſay they, the words Father and God are <hi>ſynonimous,</hi> or the ſame, becauſe the word <hi>God</hi> is explained by the word <hi>Father,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 1.3.</note> therefore the Eſſence of the Son is diſtinct from that of the Father. Our <hi>Anſwer</hi> is, Tho' the Perſons of the Father and of the Son be really diſtinct, it doth not follow that their Eſſences are ſo, as if the Eſſence of one was not that of another, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the names of Father and Son are relatives, which indeed ſignifie different Perſons in the ſame Nature, but rationally diſtinguiſhed from the ſame. If Father and Eſſence be <hi>ſynonimous,</hi> what remaineth for the Son beſides a ſhadow of
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:52204:158"/>the Deity? For as the Paternity and <hi>Innaſcibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> or not being begotten, which are proper only to the Father, are incommunicable, that Eſſence, if it be the ſame thing as is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, cannot be communicated unto the Son: It doth not follow neither that the Names <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Father</hi> are the ſame, becauſe the firſt is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times uſed for the laſt, ſeeing it is attributed unto the Father, in his Perſon to conſtitute the Deity, by reaſon of the Spring, and in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon and order of Perſons, and not becauſe the Perſon of the Father is in no wiſe diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the divine Eſſence. <hi>Paul</hi> doth congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate with the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> for their Work of Faith, Labour of Love, and Patience of Hope; and becauſe their Hope was in the Coming of the Lord Jeſus, theſe three he referreth in God, whom he calls Father, becauſe he already had made mention of the Mediator: But if the Names <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Father</hi> be the ſame, by reaſon that <hi>Paul</hi> had to the word <hi>God</hi> joyned <hi>Father,</hi> by way of explication,<note place="margin">Tit. 2.13. 2 Pet. 1.2.</note> then the Names <hi>Great God</hi> and our <hi>Saviour Jeſus Chriſt</hi> are alſo the ſame, becauſe two Apoſtles explain the name of Chriſt by that of God our Saviour. Beſides, the Argument is faulty, for it hath four terms: to the end that both Propoſitions be true, in the <hi>major</hi> the Perſon of the Father, in the <hi>minor</hi> his Eſſence, are to be underſtood. To this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument anſwereth another, The eternal Father is not the Son, whom <hi>John</hi> calls the <hi>Word,</hi> but the Eſſence of the Divinity, or that one God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> is the eternal Father of the only begotten Son, therefore the Eſſence, or the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> is not the Son called the <hi>Word:</hi> The <hi>major</hi> is falſe, for to have it true the ſence ought to be this; That Eſſence, or that God, which is the Father is not the Son, that is, the Perſon of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is not the Perſon of the Son. This farther they ſay, The Eſſence and one God are convertible, but according to us, in the Unity of God there is
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:52204:159"/>Trinity, therefore in the Eſſence there is alſo Trinity. But we ſay, God, who is one in Nature, is three in Perſons; ſo in that onely Eſſence there is a Trinity, that is, wholly and indiviſibly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in three Perſons; there are not three Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſences: The <hi>minor</hi> Propoſition muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of a Trinity of Perſons, and not of Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſences.</p>
               <p>I obſerved before how they quarrel much with ſeveral expreſſions uſed in this matter, as <hi>Trinity, Eſſence, Perſon,</hi> &amp;c. which are neither prophane nor unworthy of God, ſeeing in Scripture there are words which anſwer to them;<note place="margin">Rom. 1.20 Col. 2.9.

Thus they make themſelves really guilty of ſuch things as unreaſonably they would charge us with: They muſt needs have a very great opinion of their own abilities, ſeeing they would make us for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear the expreſſions uſed by the Church for ſo many Ages, and impoſe their new-fangled words upon the World: 'Tis in them a blaſphemous Impiety, and a damnable Slander, to charge us with bringing in new Gods under ſuch words as are made uſe of to explain Scripture; and they know well enough our meaning thereof, as we ſo often explained it: theſe different words do not change the ſenſe, ſo may not be called errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and tho' ſometimes there be Variety in words and expreſſions, the ſenſe ſtill remaineth the ſame, ſo we do not conſider them as <hi>Popiſh</hi> or Antichriſtian Forgeries. Indeed they make a ridiculous Objection, <hi>Jehovah</hi> the Eſſentiator Father, is of the <hi>maſculine</hi> Gender, but Eſſence is of the <hi>feminine,</hi> therefore not to be uſed. But to ſay ſomething to the purpoſe, they muſt prove, that in the nature of things, according to the Rules of Grammar, there is a difference of Sex: Of the like nature is this, no abſtract Name ſignifieth a Subſtance; but <hi>Trinity</hi> is an abſtract Name, therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is falſe; for when we call Deity or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, we underſtand a Subſtance, ſeeing in God all things are Subſtance and no Accident: So by the word <hi>Trinity</hi> we underſtand three Perſons really ſubſiſting.<note place="margin">2 Sam. 23.</note> We find <hi>David</hi>'s
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:52204:160" rendition="simple:additions"/>mighty Men of Valour to be diſtinguiſhed by three and three. But as to their exception againſt the fore-named words, once for all I ſay to them, Tho' every Truth aſſerted be not in Scripture, in ſo many Letters, yet if it be therein implied, and by a good and neceſſary conſequence thence derived, 'tis to be eſteemed the Word of God as if expreſſed, becauſe in it contained. Thus Preaching is the Word of God, becauſe deduced out of it, not as to the words, but as to the ſenſe: hence it is that Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching produces the effects attributed to the the Word, as to quicken, convert, regenerate, and ſanctifie, when ſometimes in a whole Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon few Sentences are repeated word by word. And in ſeveral places of the New Teſtament the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles do quote out of the Old, not in the very words, but accoding to the ſenſe and ſcope of the place: upon ſuch a ground our Tranſlators do render the word <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> by that of <hi>Perſon;</hi> and ſo 'twas a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Primitive Church; which word we find uſed in the New Teſtament only four times, thrice in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews, Chap.</hi> 1.3, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.14, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.1, and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.4. yet every where in a different ſenſe.</p>
               <p>Some few words more I ſhall add, to anſwer ſome other Objections; in order thereunto, I ſay, In the Deity there is an Eſſence which is but one; in that Eſſence do ſubſiſt three Perſons really diſtinguiſhed one from another, but only modally from the Eſſence, which doth not make any fourth thing in the Godhead. As there is but one Eſſence, ſo theſe three Perſons are but one God, which Name <hi>God</hi> is ſpoken not only of the Eſſence, but alſo of every one of the three Perſons, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> in relation to the Nature, and <hi>Trinity</hi> in reſpect to the Perſons. One Eſſence there is, without which there is no God, but the three Perſons are this one God in Eſſence, who ſubſiſt in that Eſſence, Father, Son, and
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:52204:160" rendition="simple:additions"/>Holy Ghoſt. The Adverſaries are in an Error when they think there is no real difference, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept there be ſome difference in number and Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; they would have a Thing and a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to be the ſame, when that which differeth by reaſon of the definition from another, doth alſo really differ from it: God in one number and eſſence, admitteth of no renting or diviſion, and they are not three bare Names; the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence doth not, as the <hi>Genus,</hi> contain three <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> but it doth ſubſiſt in three Perſons, in which all and in every one is the ſame Nature and Godhead: To own three Eſſences, were to aſſert three Gods; and we ſay that Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, as to the Nature, are of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, tho' not as to the Perſonality, for on this laſt account we own the Son to be from the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt from both. I ſay again, how the Eſſence maketh no fourth thing in the Godhead, as if the three Perſons were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from it as from a thing pre-exiſting, or as if it being common to the three, was really di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from the three; theſe we never ſaid, but are againſt: The Eſſence is wholly and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely common to every Perſon; theſe Perſons do not proceed from the Eſſence, but we ſay, they from all Eternity ſubſiſt in the Eſſence: and tho' we own a diſtinction between Eſſence and Perſons, yet they are not as a thing abſtracted from the Eſſence.</p>
               <p>The great difficulty ariſing about this, is in the caſe of the Incarnation, which is juſtly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The wiſdom of God in a myſtery,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.7.</note> 
                  <hi>even the hidden wiſdom which God ordained before the world unto our glory.</hi> The Son was incarnated or made Fleſh, took upon him our human Nature; now the Father and Holy Ghoſt having the ſame Eſſence with the Son, how were not they both incarnated? We know the Perſon and not the Nature was incarnated, but how the Nature, which is wholly in the Son, as wholly in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:52204:161"/>and in the Holy Ghoſt, was not made Fleſh, 'tis a Myſtery that paſſeth all underſtanding: This is one of the ſecret things that belong to God, which we muſt never attempt to pry into; this is a Myſtery which moſt humbly and with an awful reverence we ought to adore and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, without any farther enquiry into it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath revealed it, it is ſo, namely, that the Son, not the Father, nor the Holy Ghoſt, was made Fleſh. In Religion there are ſeveral other things which we do ſimply believe, tho it be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for our Reaſon to comprehend them, as, the Infiniteneſs, Immenſity, and Eternity of God, whereof the former is every where, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and without, the greateſt and leaſt things: So is that union of both Natures in one Perſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible. Thus that which is ſpoken of the divine Eſſence may be attributed to the three Perſons, but to be underſtood of things which of themſelves are competent to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Creatour, Almightineſs, Eternity, and ſuch-like Attributes; but not ſo in the things which belong to the Eſſence only upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of one Perſon, for ſuch things belong on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to that Perſon for whoſe ſake they are ſpoken of the Eſſence, as the Incarnation of the Son, the Voice of the Father from Heaven, and the appearing of the Holy Ghoſt under the ſhape of a Dove. We know how the Works <hi>ad extra,</hi> or outward, are undivided and common to the three Perſons, always excepting that wherein they deſtroy the proper Attributes of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: Thus the Son and Holy Ghoſt, not the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, are ſent; the Son, not the Father nor Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, was made Fleſh, tho' the Father and Holy Ghoſt had a hand in the Incarnation, for the Angel ſaid,<note place="margin">Luk. 1.35.</note>

After God had ſent all his Servants, and he would have no more Burnt-offerings and Sacrifices, then he ſent his only Son to offer up himſelf a Sacrifice unto him for Sin. This moſt holy and bleſſed Son, by the Mouth of the Prophet <hi>David</hi> long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his coming, ſaid, <hi>Lo, I come to do thy will,</hi>

               <p>Before we leave off theſe Objections againſt the moſt adorable Trinity, for the better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the matter, I ſhall ſpeak ſome few words more, for indeed the point is of ſo high a concernment, and affords ſuch a plenty and variety of Diſcourſe, that we can never ſay enough of what is to be known in the caſe: Tho', as we ſaid, they be the ſame in Eſſence, yet they differ, <hi>firſt,</hi> in perſonal Names, as Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghoſt: <hi>Secondly,</hi> in their Order, Father firſt as the Spring, then Son, thirdly, Holy Ghoſt. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In their manner of Operation; the Father doth act of himſelf, the Son from the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt from both:<note place="margin">Gal. 4.4. John 14.26. &amp; 15.26.</note> ſo the Son is ſent by the Father, the Holy Ghoſt from both Father and Son, but we never read the Father was ſent. So there is a difference in the outward Works, for tho' they be common to the three Perſons, yet Creation is properly attributed to the Father, Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Son, and Sanctification to the Holy Ghoſt: Thus theſe three Perſons have every one their perſonal unity, in number they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd, yet are but one God in number, of Eſſential and natural unity; wherefore in God are not three Beings, three Infinites, or three Things.</p>
               <p>Yet they object, the names of Trinity, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonality, and Eſſence were not heard of before the Apoſtles time, nor the Doctrin of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I anſwer to the firſt, that tho' the Names were not, yet the Things were, and Words are to ſignifie Things; that there is one God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, as it appears out of the places quoted to prove the Divinity of the Son and Holy Ghoſt, which here
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:52204:163"/>I need not to repeat; and if the things be true, why ſhould Men diſpute about words which do not in the leaſt prejudice the Analogy of Faith, on the contrary do explain and confirm it? As to the <hi>Second,</hi> I ſay, that the Doctrin of the Trinity was mentioned of old, as I proved it already out of ſeveral places of Scripture, the Queſtion is not about the Father, but the Son, concerning whom is the clear Teſtimony of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2, whoſe coming as <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and <hi>God of Iſrael,</hi> for the Prophet ſpeaks to <hi>Iſrael</hi> when he calls him <hi>your</hi> God, was foretold, <hi>Behold,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 35 4 5. Mat. 11.4, 5. Pſal. 51.10, 11.</note> 
                  <hi>your God will come with vengeance; even God with a recompence, he will come and ſave you:</hi> which is applied unto Chriſt. Of the Holy Ghoſt mention is made by <hi>David,</hi> and in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but that which under the Old Teſtament was under a Vail, is clearly revealed under the New, for the Perſons are plainly named, and their number expreſſed, as in the places already made uſe of, not only in the Baptiſm of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, but in his Commiſſion given his Apoſtles to baptize, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which, as I ſhewed, is unlawful to be done in any man's name: As there is truth in Jeſus, ſo this is the truth of his Goſpel, which alſo hath, in conformity thereunto, been the ſenſe of the general Orthodox Councils, and of the Doctors of the Primitive Church; however this muſt be ſaid, that tho' this Myſtery of the holy Trinity be expreſſed in Scripture, yet 'tis ſuch a one as exceedeth our underſtanding and capacity.</p>
               <p>Again they ſay, In moſt places of Scripture 'tis ſaid there is but one God, and that this God is the Father of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> I anſwer, The Name God, when properly ſpoken, and of the true God, is taken either eſſentially for Divine Nature, or perſonalty for ſome of the Perſons: when taken in the firſt ſenſe, it doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude but include the Perſons, only it is ſet down in oppoſition to Idols and falſe Gods, which by
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:52204:164"/>Nature are not Gods; the things abſolutely ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the Oneneſs of God do not at all preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice the Perſons which are that onely God: hence it is that not only the Father, but alſo Son and Holy Ghoſt are called God. In this Eſſential ſenſe are taken the places they quote out of the Old and New Teſtament; as for inſtance,<note place="margin">Mark 2.7. Luk. 5.21.</note> that of <hi>Mark</hi> and of <hi>Luke,</hi> which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others they make uſe of, <hi>Who can forgive ſins but God only?</hi> The word <hi>God</hi> belongs to the Eſſence, yet that power doth belong to the Son as to the Father, for there Chriſt aſſumeth it to himſelf; which ſame power is alſo attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto the Holy Ghoſt; <hi>Receive ye the Holy Ghoſt;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 20.21, 22.</note> 
                  <hi>whoſoever ſins ye remit, they are remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto them.</hi> When the word <hi>God</hi> is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood perſonally, then there is a note of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction joyned, to know what Perſon is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, whether Father, Son, or Holy Ghoſt. What we ſay of the word <hi>God,</hi> the ſame we affirm of the name <hi>Father;</hi> which doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſignifie the firſt Perſon, but alſo the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and three Perſons. Thus when God is ſaid to be <hi>Father</hi> of all, and in the Lord's Prayer we call him <hi>Our Father,</hi> when we cry <hi>Abba Father, &amp;c.</hi> in all Texts of that nature, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt are underſtood. As to the Particle <hi>beſides me,</hi> ſometimes uſed, it excepts nothing within, tho' every thing without the Deity, or that hath not the Divine Nature.</p>
               <p>But one of the Arguments which moſt of all they ground themſelves upon is this;<note place="margin">Joh. 17.3.</note> 
                  <hi>And this is eternal life, to know thee the only true God, and whom thou haſt ſent, Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> They would have Chriſt to be excluded from being the only true God, which they reſtrain only to the Father; but herein they are much miſtaken, for the word <hi>alone,</hi> or <hi>onely,</hi> which they lay the ſtreſs upon, doth not belong to the Subject <hi>thee,</hi> but to the Predicate; not to <hi>thee,</hi> but to <hi>true God;</hi> not to that which goes before, but to
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:52204:164"/>that which followeth after: 'Tis not ſaid to know only thee to be, but know thee to be the only true God. This we may look upon as one of their uſual pieces of Sophiſtry: our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour makes it appear, that this is the true God whom Scriptures mention, namely, the Father who ſent, and the Son that was ſent; for the true ſenſe of the place we cannot have a better Interpreter of than the Evangeliſt himſelf;<note place="margin">1 John 5.20.</note> here the true God and eternal Life are joyned in the ſame; the ſame that is eternal Life is alſo the true God, onely eternal Life, and onely true God. Now Chriſt is called true God and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life; <hi>His Son Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 10.28.</note> 
                  <hi>this is the true God and eternal life:</hi> And if here we conſider eternal Life as the Gift of the onely true God, doth not Scripture ſay in ſeveral places how eternal Life is the gift of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> Let of many this one ſerve for all, <hi>I give unto them,</hi> his Sheep, <hi>eternal life:</hi> If the Son was not that onely true God, why ſhould he joyn himſelf with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? <hi>And whom thou haſt ſent, Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to know thee, and whom thou haſt ſent Jeſus Chriſt, to be the only true God. This is the true order of the words, whereof the true ſenſe is reſolved into this, <hi>The Father is the onely true God,</hi> and <hi>not the onely or Father alone is the true God.</hi> The words in the original are not thus; <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>for his brother is dead, and he is left alone;</hi> he meaneth by the Mothers ſide, and not by the Father's, for all the reſt were his Brethren: And in the New, in the Transfiguration,<note place="margin">Luk. 9.36.</note> 'tis ſaid, <hi>And when the voice was paſt Jeſus was left alone:</hi> Certainly <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> were not excluded, for they were with him, but <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias.</hi> In the ſame ſenſe are taken <hi>Martha</hi>'s words to our Saviour, <hi>Lord, doſt thou not care that my ſiſter hath left me to ſerve alone?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 10.40</note> only meant of <hi>Mary,</hi> and not of the Servants of the Houſe. And to the matter now in hand, let it be known that Scripture never ſaith the Father only is the true God, tho' it ſays the Father is the only true God; ſo is the Son, and ſo is the Holy Ghoſt: Here Chriſt would not deny himſelf the honour of being the true God, which in other places he attributes unto himſelf, for the two words, <hi>alone</hi> and <hi>true,</hi> go with <hi>God,</hi> not with <hi>thee;</hi> and his meaning is, how true eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life conſiſts in this,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.8. 1 Theſ. 1.9. 1 Cor. 8.6.</note> that men may deteſt Idols and falſe Gods, and be converted to thee, O Father, who art the only true God by nature, which Idols are not. Thus when the name <hi>One Lord</hi> is given the Son, 'tis not to exclude the Father, who alſo is Lord; and the name <hi>Spirit</hi> given the third Perſon doth not exclude Father or Son, who alſo are <hi>Spirit:</hi> ſo this Text doth admit of the ſame conſtruction as this, when <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.6.</note> 
                  <hi>I only, and</hi> Barnabas, <hi>have we not power to forbear working?</hi> where it is plain, that <hi>Barnabas,</hi> far from being excluded, is joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and included in the ſame power with <hi>Paul:</hi> And here the thing requireth it, ſeeing eternal Life is made to conſiſt in the knowledge of Chriſt, as of the Father, wherefore both are equally ſaid to be the true God.</p>
               <p>Thoſe men who pretend to know better than God himſelf what becomes his glory, are very apt to lay hold upon any thing like to favour
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:52204:165"/>their notions; wherefore becauſe 'tis ſaid, <hi>God hath appointed his Son heir of all things,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 1.2. John 5.22.</note> and <hi>hath committed all judgment unto him,</hi> with other things to the ſame purpoſe, they with the <hi>Jews</hi> do therewith entangle themſelves, and form this Argument: It cannot conſiſt with the Majeſty of the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> of the moſt high God, to be appointed Heir by any one, but God hath appointed his Son Heir of all things, therefore his Son is not the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> nor the moſt high God. In anſwer to this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I ſay, <hi>firſt,</hi> that the Perſon of the God of <hi>Iſrael, &amp;c.</hi> is not the Perſon of his Father, but the ſame Dignity, Nature and Authority he hath, as already demonſtrated, common with the Father: he is not made Heir of all things in reference to his Nature, for he is ſuch of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by his own right and inheritance, not by favour, but in relation to his Office of Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; in which ſenſe he is not only God, but God and Man, and upon this account is all Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment committed unto him by the Father, but otherwiſe he is the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the moſt high. But, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> this Argument contains two branches, which before I have ſpoken about, yet to what hath already been ſaid this I ſhall add, to the firſt part, That the Son of God, the Lord Jeſus, above 3400 years before his being manifeſted in the Fleſh,<note place="margin">Numb. 24.17. Micah 5.2. Luk. 2.32. John 1.49. Acts 5.31.</note> was called <hi>the Star of Jacob,</hi> and <hi>the Scepter of Iſrael,</hi> and long after the <hi>ruler in Iſrael;</hi> after his birth, <hi>the glory of Iſrael;</hi> and after his Baptiſm, <hi>the King of Iſrael,</hi> which in that ſenſe and place is as good as God of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> as indeed in the ſame Verſe he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Son of God, that is, of the God of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael; a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and forgiveneſs of ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the other part, That he is not the moſt high God, we muſt in the firſt place take notice how they ſet up a <hi>high God,</hi> that is, <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and a <hi>moſt high God,</hi> the Father, which is by ſuch a
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:52204:166"/>comparative difference to make two Gods; and they would have the Son of the higheſt not to be higheſt himſelf, as to Eſſence and Power: The word <hi>moſt high</hi> or <hi>higheſt</hi> is an Hebraiſm, for in that Language God is called <hi>Helion,</hi>

The ſame high God, in whoſe name <hi>Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dec</hi> bleſſed <hi>Abraham,</hi> is the ſame who called <hi>Abraham,</hi> received him into favour, and at that time had given him Victory over four Kings, as it appears out of the place. Now, that moſt high God who called <hi>Abraham</hi> is the ſame as made a Covenant with him, who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards commanded him to ſacrifice his Son to himſelf; who is that ſame Angel, as before we have taken notice of, who is called the Lord himſelf, and upon that occaſion ſaid to him,<note place="margin">Gen. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>By my ſelf have I ſworn, ſaith the Lord,</hi> that <hi>in bleſſing I will bleſs thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy ſeed.</hi> Now the Apoſtle teaches that not only the Father, but alſo the Son, is Author of that Covenant, when he ſaith, <hi>The Teſtament,</hi> or Covenant,<note place="margin">Heb. 9.16:</note> 
                  <hi>was confirmed by the death of the Teſtator:</hi> And I would have them to tell me, who beſides Chriſt hath with his Death and Blood ſealed and confirmed that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; certainly none but that <hi>God that was manifeſt in the fleſh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 20 28.</note> that ſame <hi>God who hath purchaſed his Church with his own blood:</hi> So that <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> by the name of <hi>moſt high,</hi> meant the Son as well as the Father, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſeparated; for, as Scriptures bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:52204:167"/>the Son is always in the Father; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every where in the Word of God, the name <hi>moſt high</hi> is ſpoken of Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, which with that of <hi>God of Gods</hi> and <hi>Lord of Lords</hi> is eſſentially taken, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes indeed Creatures, but never Son and Holy Ghoſt, whom it doth truly and properly belong to.</p>
               <p>Now we are come to the Objections that are directly againſt the Divinity of the Perſon of Chriſt, which muſt be anſwered; and in order to it we muſt here premiſe ſomething which before we gave a hint of, how the word <hi>God</hi> is taken in two ſenſes, firſt, <hi>properly,</hi> then <hi>meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically,</hi> and the name <hi>God</hi> doth properly ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the true God. Now he is the only true God, who eſſentially and by nature is ſuch, for every thing is called true by its nature, as true Man, true Gold, true Silver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as ſaid before, from the nature of Man, of Gold, and of Silver, ſo that if only it be like a Man, and like Gold, then 'tis neither true Man nor true Gold, for <hi>ſimile non eſt idem,</hi> the thing like is not the ſame. If the true God be he that hath Gods Nature and Eſſence, certainly he is the high and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent God, ſeeing Divine Eſſence is in itſelf Chief and Independent. Now <hi>ſecondly</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly, or metaphorically, are they called Gods that in ſomething are like God by parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation and likeneſs, as <hi>Moſes</hi> was to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> ſo Angels and Men; but theſe metaphorical Gods may not be called true God, nor worſhipt as ſuch: that which is ſomewhat like a thing may never be called the ſame thing. Thus I do premiſe in oppoſition to <hi>Socinus</hi>'s Notion, how in Scripture the word <hi>God</hi> is taken for the high God, independent from any other, and for him who by the chief God is in ſome manner made partaker of the Divinity. In the firſt ſenſe God is God the Father, called one; in the ſecond is Chriſt, and ſome other Men; he,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:52204:167"/>becauſe of his Sanctification, and being ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, where Chriſt, as he would have it, doth not affirm himſelf to be God, but with dependency, that is, a titular, a made and coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God, as by vertue of that Sanctification and Miſſion: when that very Sanctification and ſending into the World ſhew him to be true God,<note place="margin">Joh 10.36</note> for in the <hi>place</hi> is meant that Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which preceded his coming into the World, for the Father ſanctified firſt, and then ſent him, which belonged to him, not as a Man, but had it before he was Man, and before he came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World; for he ſaith, firſt he was ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Father, and then afterwards ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World; that is, he became Man; for before he was made fleſh he had been ſanctified by the Father, that is, appointed and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Mediator and Head of the <hi>Church,</hi> but Mediator he could not be, except he were true eternal God: As to his being ſent into the World, that alſo ſheweth, that his Being is not of this World, but from above, from Heaven, whence he was ſent into the World from the Boſom of the Father; which argueth him to be above Man, and to have had a Being before he was made Man, for he was the Son of God; in Heaven he was not Man, but was made ſo upon Earth. We ſpeak of the riſing of the Sun, which hath a Being before he riſeth on our He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſphere, but only at ſuch a time he appeareth unto us, like the Star that guided the Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to the place where he was born; and of Chriſt it is ſaid, <hi>Thou haſt the dew of thy youth from the womb of the morning.</hi> As to what <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> ſaith, That Chriſt is ſaid to be God, but not that onely God, we anſwer, how Chriſt is not upon every account ſaid to be God, but only he is ſaid to be ſuch a God as true divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is due unto, who alone is to be worſhipped and ſerved, as he ſaith:<note place="margin">Mat. 4.10.</note> So he is no other but the onely God in Scripture, called the true God.</p>
               <pb n="284" facs="tcp:52204:168"/>
               <p>They object the place where the Holy Ghoſt ſaith,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8.6.</note> 
                  <hi>But to us there is but one God the Father, of whom are all things;</hi> who is diſtinguiſhed from <hi>Chriſt, who is one Lord, by whom are all things:</hi> But the Adverſaries Prejudice makes, that they either will not or cannot ſee how in the place St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth not ſeparate one <hi>God</hi> from Chriſt, nor one <hi>Lord</hi> from the Father, for his ſcope is to teach us Chriſtians, how there are not many Gods nor many Lords, but only one God and one Lord: Now if the Father was one God and one Lord ſeparately from Chriſt, then there would be two Gods and two Lords, which wholly overturns the Apoſtle's deſign; ſo that of neceſſity we muſt ſay the Father and Chriſt are one God and one Lord, conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that God and the Lord are the ſame, for there is no doubt but that God is the Lord, and he who by Divine Reaſon is Lord, and oppoſed to Idols, as 'tis the true ſenſe of the place, he alſo for certain muſt needs be God: So then when <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith that onely God to be the Father, he alſo owns him to be the onely Lord; and when he ſaith the one Lord is Chriſt, he owns him to be one God; and as he excludeth not the Father from being Lord, ſo he excludeth not Chriſt from being God. 'Tis a weak notion grounded upon theſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles <hi>of</hi> whom and <hi>by</hi> whom are all things, for both the ſame in Scripture are attributed to God,<note place="margin">Rom. 11.36.</note> 
                  <hi>Of him, and through him, and to him are all things:</hi> ſo there is in them nothing to exclude Chriſt from being God, for both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Father and Chriſt, only one is chiefly attributed to one, the other chiefly to the other. 'Tis an Error in the Adverſaries to ſay the words <hi>by whom</hi> to ſignifie a ſecond Cauſe, ſeeing that very ſame Particle is elſewhere attributed unto God, which in the ſame place we muſt alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to be attributed unto Chriſt, ſeeing the Apoſtle's mind is to ſhew there is only one God
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:52204:168"/>and one Lord: But in <hi>Socinus</hi>'s ſenſe there would be two Gods, and two Lords, one, <hi>of</hi> whom are all things; the other, <hi>by</hi> whom are all things; tho' the ſame Apoſtle doth without any ſuch Particles abſolutely affirm, <hi>There is one Lord, one God and Father of all:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epheſ. 4 5, 6.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Men muſt conceive no Myſtery to be in thoſe Particles, to make a diſtinction between God and Lord; one and the ſame Nature or Perſon is certainly God and Lord. Thus <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Pſal. 85.8.</note> 
                  <hi>I will hear what God the Lord will ſpeak.</hi> And if two be ſo, one is no prejudice to the other. Hence I conclude, how no ſtreſs is to be laid upon theſe Particles <hi>of</hi> and <hi>by,</hi> as if there were two different Natures and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; as alſo in another place already quoted, they would upon the Particle <hi>and,</hi> where 'tis ſaid, <hi>To know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> where they would have the copulative Particle to joyn different Natures and Perſons to exclude him from being the true God: but after this manner of interpreting, the words <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Father</hi> muſt import two different Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and Natures; ſo that God ſhall be one, and Father the other; for 'tis ſaid,<note place="margin">Gal. 1.4.</note> 
                  <hi>according to the will of God and our Father;</hi> which contradicts their Opinion of one onely God, namely, the Father; but in that place the words God and Father are eſſentially taken for Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, one only God.</p>
               <p>Farther they argue thus; If Chriſt be the Son of that onely God, he is not the onely God himſelf, or elſe he would be his own Son; but he is not his own Son, therefore he is not the onely God. But I anſwer, the Son is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from that one God, not as to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but as to the Perſon, for the Eſſence can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be diſtinguiſh'd, becauſe the Son hath not part of the Nature, but wholly, together with the Father, the Perſon muſt be diſtinguiſh'd,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:52204:169" rendition="simple:additions"/>for he is not Son of himſelf, but of another, tho' he be God of himſelf. Hence followeth, that as to the Nature the Son is that one God, not as to the Perſon, ſeeing in Nature it doth agree, but muſt be diſtinguiſh'd as to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>Another Objection is this; If Chriſt be the Son of that only God, then that one is not God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, but only the Father, ſo that onely God is not in three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. We anſwer, When Chriſt is called the Son of one God, one God is there taken for the Perſon of the Father, or as it ſubſiſteth in the Perſon of the Father, for Chriſt is the Son only of God the Father; but when Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt are ſaid to be one God, then one God is taken eſſentially. They need not ſay, where are one and three there are four, as if the Eſſence and three Perſons were four things really diſtinct. But we anſwer, Where are one Being and three Beings, there indeed are four, but not where are one Being and three manners of being. This may be illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by an Example of <hi>Metaphyſick,</hi> where is one <hi>Ens</hi> or Being, and three as properties or qualities <hi>unum, verum,</hi> and <hi>bonum,</hi> one muſt not conclude there are four, but <hi>unum, verum, bonum</hi> to be ſimply one Being: Wherefore ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this moſt ſimple Eſſence the Perſons are Subſiſtences, or Manners of ſubſiſting, it follows that three Perſons and one Nature do not make four in God. As to the Rule of the <hi>tertium,</hi> which I have taken notice of before, it faileth here, becauſe the Eſſence is communicable, for Divine Nature being infinite, is ſo.</p>
               <p>Now we come to ſome Objections relating to the Son of God's eternal generation; The Father alone, ſay they, is not begotten, but the Son and Holy Ghoſt are begotten and made, ſo cannot be the true God. We know how
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:52204:169" rendition="simple:additions"/>the relative Property of the Father is to beget, of the Son to be begotten, and of the Holy Ghoſt to proceed, ſo the word <hi>God</hi> is attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Son and Holy Ghoſt; that the Son is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led only begotten, becauſe he is the natural Son and the firſt born as Mediator, becauſe he hath many Brethren; he is called the brightneſs of the Father's glory, to ſhew that as from a light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Body proceeds Light, ſo the Son as natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comes from the Father: and 'tis one thing to be called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the Image of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 1.15. Heb. 1.3.</note> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the expreſs Image of the Father,</hi> but Chriſt is called both. He who is called the Image of God, is thereby diſtinguiſh'd from God, but he which is called the Character of the Father, is diſtinguiſh'd from the Father, not from God; wherefore we ſay Chriſt, as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, may be and is called the Image of God. But this comes ſhort of what is intended, to expreſs the eternal generation of the Son of God; tho' our Adverſaries would have that Filiation to be grounded upon his Mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Theſe few things, which may have a place in our Diſcourſe, being premiſed, I now direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwer the Objection: To be begotten is to be underſtood, as becomes God; to be begotten in God, doth not imply to have a beginning, or to be made in time. Secondly, they ſay, Divine Nature admitteth of no renting or diviſion, wherefore nothing doth proceed that is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in number from it. I anſwer, There is no Compariſon between the Finite and Infinite Eſſence, for this laſt is communicated to the Perſons without multiplication, ſeparation, or diviſion. Thirdly, they go on, That which is begotten hath a beginning. I <hi>anſwer;</hi> 'Tis true in the Creatures, but not in God. Fourthly, Nothing, ſay they, is wanting in the Father, ſo it is ſuperfluous to give him a Son. I <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer;</hi> The Father is perfect, therefore he hath a Son, God's fecundity makes the Perſons, but
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:52204:170" rendition="simple:additions"/>borroweth nothing from without. <hi>5thly,</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever cometh from unity to plurality cannot be perfect, except the ſubſtance be multiplied. I <hi>anſwer;</hi> God doth not come nor go, with God there is no <hi>terminus a quo,</hi> not <hi>ad quem,</hi> no place from which and to which, but God is always God, is not divided, but begets indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſibly. <hi>6thly,</hi> If the Son be from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it followeth that all the Father hath is divided, becauſe it paſſeth into the Son; ſo the Father hath given the Son part of himſelf, and ſo the Son hath deprived the Father of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. The <hi>Anſwer</hi> is, The Son is not aſunder from the Father, for the Eſſence is the ſame: There is no renting, the Father with giving loſeth nothing, but retains all, the Nature is whole in the Father, and whole in the Son, as one Candle lighteth another without any dimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of its own light. <hi>7thly,</hi> They ſay, a man hath no Son before he hath begotten. I <hi>anſwer,</hi> Nor God neither; but this I muſt ſay, 'tis a groſs miſtake to draw Conſequences from hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man things to divine, which is to meaſure God by Men: God always begetteth, as the Sun doth produce its brightneſs. <hi>8thly,</hi> If God begets, 'tis either according to his Nature or to his Will; not the firſt, for then he would beget without conſideration; if according to his Will, then the Father's Will was before the generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Son. I <hi>anſwer;</hi> He begets according to his Nature, and that freely. <hi>9thly,</hi> If the <hi>Son</hi> be born he had a beginning, ſo is not from Eternity. I <hi>anſwer;</hi> The Father is eternal, the Son eternal, and the Generation eternal: in things created, to beget, is indeed to produce that which is not; but in divine and uncreated 'tis otherwiſe. <hi>10thly,</hi> A ſpiritual Nature doth not beget. <hi>We ſay,</hi> a Spirit created doth not, but the Creator exceedeth the Reaſon of the Spiritual Creature. <hi>11thly,</hi> If the Father hath begotten the <hi>Word,</hi> either he hath begotten
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:52204:170" rendition="simple:additions"/>Himſelf, or another, but neither of theſe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore He hath not begotten; Himſelf He hath not begotten as granted, nor another neither, becauſe there is no other God, and ſo not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten at all. I anſwer the <hi>word,</hi> he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, <hi>alium non aliud,</hi> another Perſon, but not another thing; He hath begotten another, who is God, but not another God. <hi>12ly,</hi> If God hath begotten the <hi>Word,</hi> either the whole Divine Eſſence hath begotten, or only the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Perſon; if the Eſſence, then it hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Himſelf, or another; both which be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, if the Father's Perſon hath begotten, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he is the only true God, or elſe the <hi>word</hi> is not that Son of the only true God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Father hath not begotten the Son from Eternity: We <hi>anſwer,</hi> the Father hath of Himſelf begotten from Eternity, there is no neceſſity for the Father only, to be the true God, 'tis enough he is the only true God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Son is the Son of the only true God, not of two Perſons, but of the Father.</p>
               <p>Theſe Objections which I have ſet down in ſhort, and anſwer'd as briefly, I look not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as material, becauſe not taken out of the word of God, the only Judge of thoſe Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, but herein they ſhew how they affect Sophiſtry, to impoſe upon ſome ſort of People; but however, ſome Advantage we get by it, for out of all theſe it appears, how this true Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Doctrine is not contrary to the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Reaſon. They have three or four Cavils or Queſtions more, which, by the Grace of God, we ſhall anſwer in few words: <hi>Firſt,</hi> Whether the Father begat the Son when he was already a Son, or before he was the Son? I <hi>anſwer,</hi> the Father is Eternal, the Son Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and begotten from all Eternity, which hath no Parts; the Father could no more be without the Son, than the Sun without Light, or Light without Brightneſs: Their <hi>2d</hi> Queſtie
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:52204:171"/>on is, Whether the Father, after the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Son, hath begotten any other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is called the only Begotten; if he hath Begotten none other, then he hath loſt the Power of Begetting: But I <hi>anſwer,</hi> that Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is without time, always perfect, not ſucceſſive, without beginning or end. The <hi>3d</hi> is, the Father hath begotten, either unwilling or willing; if unwilling, then he hath ſuffer'd ſomething which he would not; if willing, then his Will was before the Generation of the Son; <hi>I ſay,</hi> part of this Argument was anſwered a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before, whereunto I ſhall add: The Will of God was indeed before all Creatures, <hi>for he hath done whatſoever he pleaſed;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 115.3.</note> but 'tis not ſo of the Son, for of him we read in Scripture, he <hi>was,</hi> and <hi>is</hi> with the Father; ſo the Son is no Creature, neither is he made by the Will as Creatures are; he is born of the Father, and is Co-eternal with the Perſon of the Father; the Father's Will is in Him; for in HIm he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, and by Him He doth all things: In thoſe things which proceeded from Nature, there is no Fore-counſel or Predeliberation; yet the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath not begotten, being unwilling; for He begat with a Will, not Antecedent, but Concomitant; thus the Father's Perſon is, not becauſe He was willing to be, but becauſe He is, and willeth not Himſelf not to be; ſo the Son is not born againſt the Father's Will, neither doth the Fathers Will go before His Generation. A <hi>4th</hi> preſumptuous and unbecoming this adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Myſtery, Vain and Sophiſtical Cavil of theirs is this, Did the Father ceaſe to beget? If ſo, that Diſcontinuation hath the beginning of the Son. The <hi>Anſwer</hi> is this, The Subſtance and Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God are without, and above time, and Divine Nature is not depriv'd of a begetting faculty, becauſe 'tis without time; 'tis an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety to ſay the Father diſcontinued, for then thereby would be introduced three Parts and
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:52204:171" rendition="simple:additions"/>Spaces, <hi>before, now,</hi> and <hi>after,</hi> it were a Change, which God is uncapable of, He is above thoſe things which import a Duration; Fire pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces Heat, yet is not heated by that Heat; it ſhall never ceaſe to heat, and the heat is ever perfect: But theſe Compariſons out of natural things, are very defective to repreſent thoſe high and incomprehenſible Myſteries.</p>
               <p>Out of theſe I leave the <hi>Reader</hi> to conſider the manner of Spirit, which that People are acted by; how familiar, how bold, how ſawcy they would be with God: Theſe holy things lay before them as Pearls before Swine; they ſpeak of, and handle them as they would in Schools the meaneſt Subjects of all, only to try their Wits, which therein are very Prophane, and to make a Shew of their Parts, when Men, that have a true Senſe of Piety, inſtead of going about to play with, and ridicule them, will ever think and ſpeak of them with a Religious Fear, and Awful Reverence: There is a danger for thoſe, who dare to approach to God with a ſtrange Fire, only to think on't, ſhould make Men fear and tremble.

                  <hi>the living Father hath ſent me, and I live by the Father: Socinians</hi> would have him to be the Son of God in their Senſe, after his Reſurrection; but after it, he can be the Son of God no more than <hi>David</hi> was more the Son of <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> after he came to be King; but Chriſt being the Son of God, he by his Reſurrection declared his Deity, which he had before; for as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, was declared to be, not made, the Son of God by the Reſurrection from the Dead.</p>
               <p>They continue Sophiſtically to argue thus: Divine Eſſence is the Father, Divine Eſſence is the Son; therefore the Son is the Father; after the fame manner they ſay, the Father is the true God, but the Son is not the Father, wherefore the Son is not the true God; and again, the true God is the Father of Chriſt, but the Three Perſons are not the Father of Chriſt, therefore the Three Perſons are not the true God: But theſe and the like muſt not be reckon'd among the <hi>Expoſitorious,</hi> and Categorical Syllogiſms,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:52204:172" rendition="simple:additions"/>becauſe theſe Terms, <hi>Divine Eſſence,</hi> and <hi>True God,</hi> are not incommunicable, but common to the Three Perſons, conſequently they conclude no more than do particular Affirmatives; for in a true Syllogiſm, according to the Rules, the major Propoſition is not to be particular nor equivalent to it; for from ſuch a Propoſition, when any thing communicable to more, is the ſubject of it, and is reſtrained unto one Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, out of it nothing can be concluded; and this Propoſition being made particular, the terms of the Subject or Predicate are ſuppoſed to be Reciprocal, as if <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Father</hi> be the ſame, which is falſe; we grant the Father to be the only true God, ſo we ſay of the Son; but thence it doth not follow, that the Son is the Father; for in ſaying the Father is the true God, we do not relate to his Paternity, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his Son, but to his Being and Nature, as the Scripture never ſaid, that the Father only is the true God, ſo we do not ſay, that he that is the true God is the Father only; but to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that becauſe each Perſon is God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one Perſon muſt be another, is juſt without giving any reaſon at all to diſ-believe what God hath declar'd. The Father, ſay they, is the only true God; but the Particle alone, or only is reſtrictive of the Predicate, not of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; for Son and Holy Ghoſt are the ſame God, the Perſon is not formally Perſon by the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, but by the manner of having that Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and thus there are Three Perſons of the ſame Eſſence; as to the Generation we do not ſay that the Father hath ſometimes begotten, and ſometimes not, nor that the Generative Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty is an Attribute of that Nature, but a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Propriety of the firſt Perſon; who in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar manner hath the Eſſence; wherefore tis no wonder if the other Perſons have it not.</p>
               <pb n="294" facs="tcp:52204:173"/>
               <p>But we muſt proceed upon other Objections of theirs; they ſay, every where Scripture di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſheth Father and Son one from another and never confounds them together; for it teaches that <hi>there is but one God the Father, of whom are all things, and we in Him, and one Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom are all things, and we by Him, and one Holy Ghoſt, by whom we cry Abba Father;</hi> they are diſtinguiſhed by the Manifeſtation of the Trinity in the Lord's Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and in the form of Baptiſm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</hi> They are Names Relatives, which aſſert the Diſtinction of Perſons; but becauſe they are diſtinct Perſons, it doth not follow that there is not one and the ſame Eſſence of the three Perſons, and that they are not one only God, Father, Maker and Preſerver of all; and out of the Texts they produce, they cannot make out what they intend; how the Father and the Son are never contain'd together under the Name of God; for the Perſons are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd where Scripture ſpeaketh Relatively of God, and doth oppoſe or compare them, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe their Proprieties. Further they <hi>object,</hi> they have diſtinct Eſſences, whoſe workings are diſtinct, but Father's and Son's workings are diſtinct, therefore their Eſſences are ſo: But <hi>we ſay,</hi> the major Prepoſition is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of Operations <hi>ad extra,</hi> or outward; for if whilſt one doth work; the other ceaſeth, then the Eſſences are diſtinct, but as to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward workings there is no diſtinction or diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Eſſences; far from it, that the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Son, and the Proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt, do confirm the unity of Eſſence; for by the Generation, one and the ſame whole Eſſence of the Father is communicated unto the Son, and by this ſame reaſon there is but one and the Eſſence of both: Now the <hi>Minor</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition ſpeaketh of inward Operations, and this <hi>Omonimy</hi> or Ambiguity of <hi>Terms</hi> brings in
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:52204:173"/>four <hi>Termini</hi> in the Argument, contrary to Rules; but if one and the ſame kind of Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be underſtood, then one of the Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is falſe; the <hi>major</hi> is underſtood of thoſe, <hi>ad imra,</hi> the <hi>minor</hi> of thoſe <hi>ad extra,</hi> and in the caſe of the Incarnation, there are two terms to be conſider'd; <hi>a quo</hi> from whom, and <hi>ad quem</hi> to or in whom, tho' as thus it be termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natively in the Son, yet <hi>a quo,</hi> or originatively, it is the work of the whole Trinity.</p>
               <p>Another Argument of theirs is this, the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence unbegotten and begetting is not the ſame with the Eſſence begotten and not begetting, but the Eſſence of the Father is unbegotten, yet hath begotten the Son, but the Son's is begotten yet nor begetting, therefore the Eſſence of the Father is not the ſame with that of the Son: This Argument is borrow'd from the <hi>Arrians,</hi> whereof the <hi>minor</hi> Prepoſition is falſe; namely, that the Eſſence of the Son is begotten, the Names begotten, or not begotten, do not belong to the Eſſence, but ſhew an Hypoſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal or Perſonal Difference: Should the Eſſence beget, it would either beget it ſelf; and ſo ſhould be begotten of it ſelf, ſo it would make many different Eſſences of the Godhead, whence would follow many Gods. Moreover, as in natural things, not the Eſſence but the <hi>compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> doth beget, ſo in divine things the Perſon begets, and is begotten, which yet is not a vain Relation, ſeeing it is not conſtituted without the Eſſence. Now, if it were true, that the Divine Eſſence doth beget, one could ſay, either the Son doth beget, or deny the Son to have the Divine Eſſence. Again, <hi>They ſay,</hi> Two or three diſtinct Perſons have ſo many diſtinct Eſſences, for the diſtinction of Eſſences doth follow that of Perſons; ſo then Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, being three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Perſons, they have three diſtinct Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; but the firſt Prepoſition is true, only in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:52204:174" rendition="simple:additions"/>not in Divine things; beſides, they are in a miſtake, when they think there is no real Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, except the things do differ in an Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Number, when there are ſeveral things that differ in the thing and definition, which yet in Eſſence and Number are but one: Here by the by, I ſay, the words <hi>like</hi> and <hi>likeneſs,</hi> when a Compariſon is made between the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, is not convenient to be uſed, but <hi>equal</hi> and <hi>equality,</hi> which indeed containeth a like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but ſomething above: Another thing I ſhall add here, how ſome things are properly ſpoken of the Eſſence, which alſo are properly ſpoken of the Perſons, for 'tis properly ſaid of the Eſſence and of the Perſons, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, that they are Spirit and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for the word <hi>Spirit</hi> is ſpoken of as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and eſſential,<note place="margin">John 4.24.</note>

               <p>If we look upon the Son of God, as he is from Eternity begotten of the Father, and as he is the ſecond Perſon, on ſuch an account we own the Son to be from the Father, ſeeing he is true Son; but if we conſider him as God, he is altogether ſelf God, and God of himſelf; for the Divinity is wholly unbegotten, and of her ſelf, knoweth of no beginning, and needs not to borrow of others what it hath of it ſelf;
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:52204:176"/>and if to the Son one would attribute a Begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and formed Eſſence, this is from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to make a ſecond God. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Many of the Places which the Adverſaries do heap up, do ſpeak of Chriſt's Office of Mediator, which they improperly miſapply to his Divine Nature, for though Chriſt's Humane Nature hath no Perſonality, but is upheld by the Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, yet that upholding doth not confound the Natures, otherwiſe Paſſion and Death might be attributed to Divine Nature. On this Matter they form other Arguments, grounded upon falſe Suppoſitions, as ſometimes they would have Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, to be three Spirits, and the words unbegotten, begotten, and proceeding to be Eſſential Differences; when to ſpeak of three Spirits in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, is as good as to ſay there are three Gods,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8.4.</note> whilſt Scripture ſaith <hi>there is none other God but one,</hi> who hath his Being from himſelf, and from none elſe, for we muſt ſay of every God ſo called, which is not ſuch by Nature,<note place="margin">Hoſea 8.6.</note> what the Prophet ſaith of the Calf of <hi>Samaria; the workman made it, therefore it is not God;</hi> and 'tis a right Conſequence, for nothing can be God that is made by another: So then to talk of three Spirits in the Godhead, is to ſet up three Gods; for <hi>God,</hi> as our Saviour ſaith, abſolutely <hi>is a Spirit;</hi> and when we ſay Spirit, we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand his Nature, for a Spirit is a Spiritual Subſtance and being; thus, they go on ſtill up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Suppoſitions, they would have the words unbegotten, begotten and proceeding, to be eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Differences, and not perſonal as they are, ſo other times they would have the Son, becauſe he is of the Father, not to be one God with the Father, who exiſteth of himſelf, and ſo not to be the one true God, becauſe he hath a Being from another, but we muſt diſtinguiſh between the being of Eſſence, and that of the Perſon, the firſt the Son hath of it ſelf, and the ſecond of the Father.</p>

<pb n="303" facs="tcp:52204:177"/>the Office of Mediator, but alſo they that are joyn'd, and about it agreed with him; wherefore, ſeeing in every thing, the Will of Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt be agreed, it followeth, that through the Merit and Satisfaction of the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, the Father being fully ſatisfied, the Son and Holy Ghoſt are ſo too. I add as to the <hi>ſecond,</hi> it is not abſurd as they think, that the Son ſhould be Mediator with himſelf, for the Son of God doth the Office of Mediator in both Capacities; for, as God being one with the Father, he receiveth us into Favour; and as he is Mediator according to both Natures, ſo as he is God, manifeſted in the Fleſh, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his Merit and Satisfaction, we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into favour; and although this being received into favour be common to Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, yet the Mediator is ſaid to intercede for us with the Father, who is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd as the Spring of all Divine Counſels and Operations; who being willing that the Son ſhould ſatisfie for our Sins, and that by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that ſatisfaction, our Sins ſhould be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, it is not poſſible for the Son to will and do otherwiſe; to this purpoſe makes what the Apoſtle ſaith about our being <hi>reconciled to God by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and what the Evangeliſt wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, <hi>he that hath my commandments,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">John 14.21, 23.</note> to the ſame effect doth tend what is ſaid in another place of Chriſt, who, <hi>when he had by himſelf purged our Sins, ſat down on the right hand of the majeſty on high:</hi> So then the Son is appeaſed,<note place="margin">Heb. 3.3.</note> and forgiveth our ſins, receiveth us into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and giveth us Eternal Life, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his own ſatisfaction.

<pb n="304" facs="tcp:52204:178" rendition="simple:additions"/>his own ſake receiveth us, tis call'd his Will, in relation to the Father, 'tis call'd Mediation or Interceſſion; therein the Will of the Son, in order of the Perſon and Divine Working, doth follow the Will of the Father. Hence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, how they do ill, to confound the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature of Chriſt under his Office of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, as ſuch; according to his Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he pray'd to the Father, and taught us a form of Prayer, that we ſhould call upon the Father through the Mediator, yet he thereby never intended to exclude or deprive himſelf of his own Due or Right, there is no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to worſhip the Father in the Face, and thorough the Interceſſion of the Mediator, for we worſhip the Father not in his Perſon only, but of the whole Nature; and Chriſt in <hi>John</hi> 5.22. as in the form of Baptiſm, propoſeth himſelf to be worſhipped; for Adoration is not confined in the Perſon of the Father only.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XI. <hi>Some Animadverſions upon a Book called,</hi> Chriſtianity not Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</head>
               <p>WHAT I ſaid ſomewhat before concerning Reaſon, puts me in mind of a thing I promiſed about the middle of my Diſcourſe, namely, to take notice of a Book with the Title of <hi>Chriſtianity not myſterious;</hi> wherein the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor undertakes to ſhew, there is nothing in the Goſpel, or in our Religion, againſt or above Reaſon: And tho' I have hardly any room left, yet to be as good as my word, I muſt briefly ſay ſomething to it.</p>
               <p>We agree with him againſt all human Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, contrary to the Word, and own Scripture to be the only competent Judge, and allow of our Reaſon, as long as it draweth out of that Spring, and not otherwiſe. Let us be ſincere, and avoid Ambiguities, there is true and ſound Reaſon, whereof the Word of God is the right and ſtanding infallible Rule, for the Will of God is the meaſure of all Truth and Equity, and our Reaſon, to be Reaſon indeed, muſt be guided by that, or elſe it doth deviate from the Rule. There is alſo that which is called Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but is not really ſo, meerly human, ſubject to Error, a meer Chimera and Fancy of Man's ſhallow Brains, according to this natural Reaſon Men willing thereby to judge of ſpiritual things,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:52204:184"/>to ſpeak in <hi>Paul</hi>'s words, <hi>profeſſing themſelves to be wiſe, become ſools;</hi> far from being rational, are unreaſonable, and have forfeited their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; for Scripture oppoſeth human Reaſon to divine, Man's Wiſdom to God's, as may be ſeen in the places quoted in the margin,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.18, 19, <hi>to</hi> 30. &amp; Chap. 2.4, 5, 6, 13, 14. Jam. 3.15.</note> which I deſire the Reader to peruſe, and a little lower I ſhall have occaſion to mention. And another Apoſtle ſpeaks of this human Wiſdom or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (for the rational man is the wiſe man) in oppoſition to the divine with a witneſs, when he ſaith, <hi>This wiſdom deſcendeth not from above, but is earthly, ſenſual, deviliſh;</hi> but true <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom the Lord giveth;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 2.6. Jam. 1.5.</note> and <hi>If any lack wiſdom, let him ask of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We do not deſtroy our Reaſon when we ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and make it ſubordinate to Scripture, for human muſt depend upon divine Reaſon, or elſe 'tis blaſphemouſly to deny there is more of and better Reaſon in God than in Man; ſo we muſt own there is in God more of good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon than in us: wherefore Reaſon is not inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently to be lodged in our weak Brains, but in the Wiſdom of God, in his Word. Thus our Reaſon is not to be the Rule of Faith, for 'tis ſo apt to fail, to be miſled and impoſed upon; but the Spirit of God ſpeaking in Scripture, and to our Spirits, is not ſo, we are ſaid to be <hi>the Epiſtle of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.3.</note> 
                  <hi>written not with Ink,</hi> or any human and natural thing, <hi>but with the Spirit of the living God.</hi> It is ſtrange, that whilſt this man doth ſo much plead for Reaſon he is ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable in ſome things he ſaith; as, <hi>par.</hi> 4.5. that after he hath juſtly taken away an infallible Authority, from a Council or a Pope, that is, from a collective Body and a company of Men, yet he would lodge it in every ſingle man, in his ſhallow Brain, mine, and any ones elſe. We own, 'tis every man's Duty and Concern to enquire and exerciſe his Reaſon about Faith and Religion, but to make either depend upon his
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:52204:184"/>Reaſon, is to build upon the Sand, to make the infallible depend upon the fallible, and confound matters of Faith with thoſe of Fact.</p>
               <p>But to the end we may know what we ſpeak of, 'tis neceſſary to ſay ſomething about Reaſon, the thing moſt excellent in Man, for he thereby is made to differ from meerly ſenſitive and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable Creatures, and it gives him a denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, for from Reaſon he is called reaſonable, from his nobleſt part reaſonable Soul, which, as School-men ſay, is Man's <hi>forma informans,</hi> and makes him to be what he is. Now Reaſon is ſeated in the Underſtanding, which is the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour part of the Soul, and the Judgment-ſeat of all things offered to her conſideration, there to be examined, whether true or falſe, which is the Object of the Operation of the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as Good or Evil is that of the determination of the Will. But how theſe Objects come into the Mind, Intellect, or Underſtanding, which are the ſame, this is the uſual order about it, which God hath ſetled in Nature: Firſt, The Objects that are outward are offered to the Organ of the Senſe, as may be the Eye of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Ear of hearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates it to the Senſe, whence they paſs into the Imagination, and thence are convey'd into the Mind, which is the Receiver and Looking-glaſs of all Forms; for, as the Hand is called the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of Inſtruments, ſo is the Intellect the Form of Forms, and can underſtand all things intelligible, by means of the Brain, the Organ of it.</p>
               <p>Tho' upon the preſent occaſion this matter ought to be handled more Theologically than Philoſophically, however ſomething muſt be ſaid in relation to this: as the Organs of Senſe, for inſtance that of Seeing, receive Objects, either by emiſſion or intromiſſion of viſual beams, a Diſpute in Philoſophy, not proper here to be meddled with, but 'tis certain it receives them;
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:52204:185"/>ſo doth the Underſtanding Objects conveyed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, whether by means of intelligible or inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional <hi>Species,</hi> 'tis not to our purpoſe, no more than whether they be there objectively or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively as an <hi>Ens rationis,</hi> or real, as are Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. But this muſt be known, that in Man are the <hi>Intellect,</hi> a Faculty of the Soul; <hi>Science,</hi> an Habit of that Faculty, and <hi>Knowledge,</hi> an Act proceeding from the Faculty through the Habit. The working of the Underſtanding is done ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively, and through many Acts, which ſome Philoſophers reckon to be eight in number, that may well be reduced under three; the <hi>firſt</hi> is, the receiving and apprehending of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; the <hi>ſecond</hi> is, the working of the Mind to reduce into order, and diſpoſe thoſe Objects into a good form, and this is properly <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, a ratiocinative Diſcourſe, or a working and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Mind from one to another, whence ariſeth the right Underſtanding, and as it were the Decree and Sentence about the thing. This is the natural order in theſe matters: Now hence let us conclude ſome things.</p>
               <p>Reaſon is Knowledge upon true grounds, and herein we muſt ſee how far we may truſt our Reaſon; according to the Rule in Philoſophy, <hi>Nihil cadit ſub intellectu quod non fucrit prius ſub ſenſu;</hi> 
                  <q>Nothing comes under the Intellect but what before hath been under the Senſe.</q> And ſince the Organs are often deceived by the Objects, the Senſes by the Organs, the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by Senſes, it is a rational conſequence to ſay, that the Mind may alſo thereby happen to be impoſed upon from the very firſt ſtep. In the caſe of Seeing three things are neceſſary, the thing that ſeeth, the thing ſeen, and the <hi>medium</hi> or help, without which no ſeeing; the Eye is the ſeer, but if blind it cannot ſee, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it ſee except there be ſomething to be ſeen; then the <hi>medium</hi> is the light which helps
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:52204:185"/>us to ſee, for in the dark, Objects cannot be diſcerned; alſo there ought to be a proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable diſtance between Organ and Object; a Man cannot from the Street ſee a Pin upon the top of a Steeple, becauſe it is too remote: Our Mind is the Eye of the Soul, and tho' Reaſon feated in it hath Objects offered, it cannot rightly judge without the <hi>medium,</hi> even about natural things, elſe how could there among Men, who all have a rational Soul, be ſo many different and contrary Judgments about the ſame things? The reaſon of our Mind muſt be grounded upon the reaſon of the thing, which is that whereby the thing is ſo: We ſay, why is it day? The reaſon is good, becauſe the Sun is up, for that is the cauſe of the day: ſo that Certainty is not grounded upon the clearneſs of our perceiving, as upon the mainneſs of the Evidence confirmed by a continual Experience. Now natural Reaſon is fitted for natural Things, but for ſupernatural it muſt be ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally endowed: And beſides Ideas, a due temper and application of the Mind are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But about divine things, beſides what is in us, there ought to be a Rule in them, which is Revelation; this is the <hi>medium</hi> or middle between Eye and Object, without which in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things we can ſee nothing till the Lord openeth our Eyes. When an Army of <hi>Syrians</hi> had compaſſed <hi>Dothan,</hi> to take <hi>Eliſha,</hi> his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant ſeeing ſo many Horſes and Chariots, was afraid, till at the Prayer of the Prophet the Lord opened the Eyes of the young man,<note place="margin">2 Kings 6.15, 16, 17.</note> then and not before, <hi>he ſaw the mountain full of Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and chariots of fire round about Eliſha.</hi> Theſe Heavenly Armies cannot be ſeen by a meer na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Eye, it muſt be enlightned from above: As we cannot know a thing of which we have no Idea, ſo we muſt have a true one, to make a right Judgment of it, or elſe we go upon a wrong bottom, and it ſtill remains a Myſtery to
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:52204:186"/>us. The true Notion we ought to have of a Myſtery is this, namely, ſomething that is hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from our Knowledge and above our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: ſee what a falſe Idea a learned and rational man, a Maſter of <hi>Iſrael, Nicodemus,</hi> had of Regeneration, as we ſhall ſee ſomewhat lower; it was a very neceſſary and truly rational thing to believe in Chriſt,<note place="margin">Joh. 7.48.</note> yet <hi>Have any of the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and Phariſees believed on him?</hi> Thoſe men in their way wanted not Reaſon; <hi>God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.27.</note> 
                  <hi>hath choſen the fooliſh things of the world to confound the wiſe.</hi> The greateſt commendation of Mans Reaſon is, to call it Wiſdom; yet it is confounded about ſpiritual things: for this very thing our Saviour rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in ſpirit, and gave his Father Thanks for revealing the Myſteries of ſalvation unto Babes, which the wiſe and prudent of the World could not underſtand for want of this Revelation, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.21. Wherefore when God will have his People to know him, he ſaith not, their Reaſon and Mind ſhall know me, but <hi>I will give them an heart to know me, that I am the Lord, Jer.</hi> 15.7. This Knowledge is not an effect of their Reaſon, but the Gift of God. The right Judgment of a thing doth ſometimes depend upon ſo many different circumſtances, that a miſtake in one of them doth much alter the thing, and ſo pervert the Judgment; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, our Underſtanding being often di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed through Paſſion and Prejudice, it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by lyeth under great miſtakes: If ſo in natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and temporal things, how much more in ſpiritual and eternal, wherein the diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the Underſtanding and Object is infinitely greater! Yet that ſort of People make no difference in reaſoning about the Word of God and human Writings, with them it is all one to judge of God or of Men, and their Reaſon they make the Judge of both: This is to ſet up a Tribunal, which God will never
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:52204:186" rendition="simple:additions"/>allow of, to inquire after, and examine his ways and works,<note place="margin">Job 33.13.</note> when <hi>he giveth no account of any of his Matters;</hi> that is, he is not bound, tho' ſometimes out of his gracious Condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he be pleaſed to do't. But once for all, I muſt warn thoſe Men, who ſo much dote up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their own reaſon, to have a care, leſt that very ſame, thorough a juſt Judgment of God, doth to them as to others, prove fatal; for they glory too much in it. <hi>Abſalom</hi>'s Hair was his Pride, and it became his Halter; <hi>Jezebel</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in painting her Face, which, as ſhe thought, made her full of Charms; but a while after it was waſhed off with her own Blood: <hi>Herod</hi>'s Robes were glorious when he ſat upon his Throne to make a Speech to the People, but very ſoon after they were full of Worms, whereby he was eaten up. They who truſt to, and glory in their Reaſon, have cauſe to fear ſome ſuch end or other will befall them: But we rely on the word of God, and depend upon the Goſpel, as it is a promiſe of Grace, and muſt endeavour to conform to it, as it is the rule of Life.</p>
               <p>All he ſaith, <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. and <hi>Chap</hi> 1. doth not concern us, who hold the Doctrines of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel not to be contrary to true and ſound Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; in his Philoſophical Notions he conſounds himſelf that is in the whole firſt-Section, and <hi>4th</hi> Chapter thereof.</p>
               <p>As to his <hi>Ideas,</hi> or Evidences, Experience, which is a good reaſon, though not always, for it falls ſometimes, ſheweth how every Man hath not the ſame Idea or Notion of this or that thing, and that which is Evidence to one, is not to another; then he goeth upon a falſe Suppoſition, as if the Devil; thorough his Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geitions, and the Corruptions of our Heare, did not ſometimes darken our Light, deceive our Mind, pervert our Judgment, and over-rule our Affections; 'tis ſo in worldly things, much
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:52204:187"/>more in Spiritual; thus, thorough their vain Sophiſtry, they would ſet up this Reaſon as an independant and infallible Judge in Man, and ſo overthrow whatſoever Scripture in ſo many places declareth of the Blindneſs, Darkneſs, and Ignorance of our Underſtanding, and of the Perverſeneſs, Corruption, and Stubbornneſs of our Heart.</p>
               <p>The Texts he quoteth, <hi>Pag.</hi> 47, 48. are true and good, but he ſhould go further, and own Chriſt to be true God, not only in his Works, but alſo in his Nature; he ſometimes hath ſome good and true things like Grains, to make Chaff Currant, thus, <hi>Pag.</hi> 49, 50. he condemns thoſe that ſay the New-Teſtament to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten without any Order or Scope, but only as Matters came into the Heads of the Apoſtles, which is a <hi>Socinian</hi> Tenet, yet he there ſeems to be againſt it.</p>
               <p>The Phyſical Impotency to underſtand the Myſteries of Religion, is not abſolute, but 'tis all one as if it was ſo, without the Help of Grace, as a blind Man cannot ſee, a dumb ſpeak, a dead Man perform any Vital Action, as of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but if God pleaſes he ſhall be reſtored to his Sight, Speech and Life. There is a moral Impotency to underſtand Matters and Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Religion; we have a Mind, but dark, blind, and ignorant; can a blind Man ſee, tho he hath Eyes? a deaf hear, tho he hath Ears? a dumb ſpeak, tho he hath a Tongue, a dead Man act, tho he hath Organs, as Hands and Feet; no, if he had but a <hi>Dead-Palſie:</hi> Men, by Revelations, are not endued with new Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, but theſe old Faculties are enabled to act, which they could not before; God gives a new Heart, a new Spirit, new Thoughts, new Affections.</p>
               <p>His Diſcourſe of <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. is all out of the Purpoſe; the things he ſpeaks of are Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and unneceſſary, as how Rain is formed in
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:52204:187"/>the Air, but Matters of Religion are Spiritual and neceſſary; Matters of Election, manner of Converſion, without a revelation in the Word, are incomprehenſible, as our Saviour ſaith to <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> in point of Regeneration, <hi>The wind bloweth where it liſteth, and thou heareſt the ſound thereof,</hi>

To know things, we muſt know their Eſſence and Nature; as to God, we, by the Light of Nature, may know there is one, but what he is, muſt be reveal'd; and 'tis uſual, when we ſpeak of any thing, to have a Definition or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of it: What is a Man? a rational Animal?

               <p>He goeth upon a Miſtake, as if we thought Matters of Religion to be Myſteries after the Revelation, which makes them ceaſe to be My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, which they were before: ſo 'tis in him labour in vain, <hi>Pag.</hi> 91. When a Prophecy is fulfill'd it ceaſeth to be a Prophecy, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Hiſtory. The ſtrength of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment lays herein, that thoſe things once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed are no longer Myſteries. But we muſt know how ſome things are wholly revealed, and others but in part; it is true, we muſt yield an Obedience of Faith, that the thing is ſo, as that the Son of God was made Man, that there are three Perſons in the Godhead, God having revealed it, we are fully perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it is ſo; but the manner and how, we are in the dark about, it is incomprehenſible by, and unconceivable to us; and beyond the power of our Nature to know it, yet as much as is neceſſary, tis revealed; here I cannot avoid ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice how the Man unworthily compares the Myſteries of our holy Religion, with the Tricks and Cheats of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> Page 99. and what? If what in their falſe Worſhip they called Myſteries, there were Cheats, as we own, doth it follow it muſt be ſo in our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Theirs was Idolatry and Superſtition, but ours is Holy and Divine, then after this Rule, becauſe they had falſe Gods, we muſt have none at all, and ſo muſt be as bad as they; the Devil, who is God's Ape, and in imitation of God's Church, hath ſet up a Synagogue for himſelf, hath his Drudges and Bondſlaves to ſerve him, muſt not God's People adore him? and becauſe there is a falſe Worſhip, muſt there be no true
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:52204:189"/>one? Thus for Men, who ſo much pretend to Reaſon; 'tis a very unreaſonable Inference to ſay, that becauſe the <hi>Heathens</hi> in their Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Idolatry had Tricks, which they call'd Myſteries, therefore the Myſteries of our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Religion muſt be Cheats and Tricks: Such compariſons are odious, and unworthy to be uſed by any who call themſelves Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Then, if Myſtery does relate ſometimes to the Matter, and ſometimes to the Manner, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Points of our Religion, as the Trinity, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Generation of the Son, Proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt, were a Myſtery before they were reveal'd, it follows, That the Revelation was neceſſary to make them known unto us, and that it was not in the Power of our Reaſon to know them without Revelation, ſo they were above it; and thus, tho' the thing be re-reveal'd, ſo that we muſt believe it, yet ſtill there are ſome things that be unreveal'd, and above our Capacity.

This Author is one of thoſe whom the Prophet ſpeaks of,<note place="margin">Pſal. 64.5.</note> 
                  <hi>They encourage themſelves in an evil matter;</hi> for at firſt he concealed his Name, whether out of Fear or Modeſty he knows beſt, but now in his ſecond Edition he pulled off the Vizzard, and hath his Name at length, how he came by that Encouragement, deſerves, as I think, to be inquired into by thoſe that are more than I, immediately concerned.</p>
               <p>I agree with him when he ſpeaks the Truth as thus, how the Converted <hi>Jews</hi> would ſtill retain ſome of the Levitical Ceremonies, as may be ſeen, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. and therein might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be too much Compliance, as with the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who brought in ſome of the Heatheniſh Rites, and that Remiſneſs in ſome, afterwards
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:52204:194"/>made thoſe things a part of Chriſtianity it ſelf; thus they degenerated from the Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Goſpel, by means of ſelf and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ends: Hence we ſee how from Page 165, till 172, he takes Advantage upon account of Ceremonies, and ſuch fooliſh or ſelffiſh Prieſtcraft as he calls it.

                  <hi>Thy commandment is exceeding broad,</hi> becauſe it contains the whole Revelation of God unto us, which is full of infinite Wiſdom in the whole Frame and Order of it; and as the Revelation in the Word is from God, ſo is the Underſtanding of that Revelation; that is the reaſn why Men ſhould not, as ſome do, perplex themſelves, to find out the Grounds and Suitableneſs of ſome things in the New-Teſtament, with others in the Old, when they ſhould know how 'tis not in their Power to know the heighth, depth, length and breadth of God's Infinite Wiſdom therein contained, when, may be, the Holy Ghoſt aimeth at ſuch things as they cannot dive into, who by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees openeth Man's Eyes more and more, to know things neceſſary for them; for as the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.2.</note>

                  <hi>and of the Father, and of Chriſt,</hi> and in the following Verſe he gives an inſtance of it, <hi>in whom are hid all the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledge.</hi> That thing is ſo, he gives it as Matter of Faith by us to be believed; but how it is, and how all theſe Treaſures are hid in him, 'tis for us a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious thing.</p>
               <p>Every Nation, whether <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> in matter of Religion, had Myſteries, ſo Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans have theirs, and in particular that of the Incarnation, which the Apoſtle calls a great one beyond all Diſpute and Compariſon, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all this, ſurely there are great Myſteries in Religion, God, whoſe infinite Nature and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes are the Ground of all Religion, is the greateſt Myſtery of all, and moſt incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible;
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:52204:197"/>for this Reaſon the Trinity and Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are great Myſteries, and above Reaſon, tho' not contrary to't: Theſe Doctrines indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain great Difficulties, but no Contradictions which theirs do, as to ſet up a Metaphorical and Figurative God, ſecondary, ſubordinate, a Creature to be God by Office, not by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a God, but of 1700 ſtanding, and this Creature God to be worſhipped, is not this downright Idolatry? Herein we muſt go no farther than Scripture leads us, for fear of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of our Depth, and loſing our ſelves in the deep things of God; many more things to our purpoſe, I could ſay upon this Matter; but for the preſent have no time nor place left to do't.</p>
               <p>But to come to a Concluſion of the whole and main Subject, to all that hath been ſaid, I ſhall add this out of the Prophet, where the Husband of the Church of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> that were to be call'd to communion with Chriſt, is ſaid to be <hi>the Lord of hoſts,</hi>
